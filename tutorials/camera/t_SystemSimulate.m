%% Initialize ISET 
ieInit

%% Initialize some parameters

% In this example, wavelengths range between 400 and 710 nm, sampled every
% 5 nm. It is also possible to expand the range to include wavelengths in
% the near infrared (NIR) range. Of course, this would only make sense if your
% imaging sensor has sensitivity in the NIR range. 
wave = 400:5:710; 

%% Scene
% Create a radiometric description of the scene.
% There are several ways to create a scene. 
% see scripts/scenes for more information about scenes
%
% One is to use the sceneCreate function.  
% In the example below, we create a scene of the Macbeth Color Checker
% illuminated with a tungsten light
% For a complete list of the types of synthetic scenes type "help sceneCreate"
%
% A second method for creating a scene is to read data from a file.  
% ISET includes a few multispectral scenes as part of the distribution.
% These can be found in the data/image/multispectral directory
% You can also select the file (or many other files) using the command:
%    fullFileName = vcSelectImage;
%
% see s_sceneFromMultispectral.m, s_sceneFromRGB.m

patchSize = 64;
scene = sceneCreate('macbeth tungsten',patchSize,wave);

% It is often useful to visualize the data in the scene window
sceneWindow(scene);

%%
% Each scene has a stored illuminant. 
%
scenePlot(scene,'illuminant energy roi');

%%
% It is possible to change the scene illuminant
scene = sceneAdjustIlluminant(scene,'D65.mat');
scene = sceneSet(scene,'name','D65'); % Set the scene name
sceneWindow(scene);

%%
% Once the scene is loaded, you can adjust different properties
% using the sceneSet command.  Here we adjust the scene mean luminance and
% field of view.
scenePlot(scene,'illuminant energy roi');
scene = sceneAdjustLuminance(scene,200);  % Candelas/m2
scene = sceneSet(scene,'fov',26.5);       % Set the scene horizontal field of view
scene = sceneInterpolateW(scene,wave,1);  % Resample, preserve luminance
% sceneWindow(scene); % if you want to view the change in the GUI window
%% Optics
% see t_IntroductionOI.m
%
% The next step in the system simulation is to specify the optical image
% formation process.  The optical image is an important structure, like the
% scene structure.  We adjust the properties of optical image formation
% using the oiSet and oiGet routines.
%
% ISET has several optics models that you can experiment with. These
% include shift-invariant optics, in which there is a different
% shift-invariant pointspread function for each wavelength, and a ray-trace
% method, in which we read in data from Zemax and create a shift-variant
% set of pointspread functions along with a geometric distortion function.
%
% The simplest is method of creating an optical image is to use 
% the diffraction-limited lens model.  To create a diffraction-limited
% optics with an f# of 4, you can call these functions
oi = oiCreate;

optics = oiGet(oi,'optics');

oi = oiSet(oi,'optics fnumber',4);
% optics = opticsSet(optics,'fnumber',4);

% In this example we set the properties of the optics to include cos4th
% falloff for the off axis vignetting of the imaging lens, and we set the
% lens focal length to 3 mm. 
oi = oiSet(oi,'optics off axis method','cos4th');
oi = oiSet(oi,'optics focal length',3e-3);     % from lens calibration software

% We use the scene structure and the optical image structure to update the
% irradiance.
oi = oiCompute(scene,oi);

% We save the optical image structure and bring up the optical image
% window.
oiWindow(oi);

% From the window you can see a wide range of options. These include
% insertion of a birefringent anti-aliasing filter, turning off cos4th
% image fall-off, adjusting the lens properties, and so forth.
%
% You can read more about the optics models by typing "doc opticsGet".
% You can see an online video about using the ray trace software at:
%   http://www.imageval.com/public/Products/ISET/ApplicationNotes/ZemaxTutorial.htm
% 
%% Sensor
% The irradiance is then captured by a simulated sensor, resulting
% in an array of output voltages.
% There are a very large number of sensor parameters. Here we illustrate
% the process of creating a simple Bayer-gbrg sensor and setting a few of
% its basic properties.
%
% To create the sensor structure, we call
sensor = sensorCreate('bayer (gbrg)');

% We set the sensor properties using sensorSet and sensorGet routines.
%
% Just as the optical irradiance gives a special status to the optics, the
% sensor gives a special status to the pixel.  In this section we define
% the key pixel and sensor properties, and we then put the sensor and pixel
% back together.

% To get the pixel structure from the sensor we use:
pixel =  sensorGet(sensor,'pixel');

% Here are some of the key pixel properties
voltageSwing   = 1.15;  % Volts
wellCapacity   = 9000;  % Electrons
conversiongain = voltageSwing/wellCapacity;   
fillfactor     = 0.45;       % A fraction of the pixel area
pixelSize      = 2.2*1e-6;   % Meters
darkvoltage    = 1e-005;     % Volts/sec
readnoise      = 0.00096;    % Volts

% We set these properties here
pixel = pixelSet(pixel,'size',[pixelSize pixelSize]);   
pixel = pixelSet(pixel,'conversiongain', conversiongain);        
pixel = pixelSet(pixel,'voltageswing',voltageSwing);                                             
pixel = pixelSet(pixel,'darkvoltage',darkvoltage) ;               
pixel = pixelSet(pixel,'readnoisevolts',readnoise);  

%  Now we set some general sensor properties
% exposureDuration = 0.030; % commented because we set autoexposure
dsnu =  0.0010;           % Volts (dark signal non-uniformity)
prnu = 0.2218;            % Percent (ranging between 0 and 100) photodetector response non-uniformity
analogGain   = 1;         % Used to adjust ISO speed
analogOffset = 0;         % Used to account for sensor black level
rows = 466;               % number of pixels in a row
cols = 642;               % number of pixels in a column

%%  Set these sensor properties
% sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'exposuretime',exposureDuration); % commented because we set autoexposure
sensorSet(sensor,'autoExposure',1);  
sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'rows',rows);
sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'cols',cols);
sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'dsnu level',dsnu);  
sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'prnu level',prnu); 
sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'analog Gain',analogGain);     
sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'analog Offset',analogOffset);   

% Stuff the pixel back into the sensor structure
sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'pixel',pixel);
sensor = pixelCenterFillPD(sensor,fillfactor);

% It is also possible to replace the spectral quantum efficiency curves of
% the sensor with those from a calibrated camera.  We include the
% calibration data from a very nice Nikon D100 camera as part of ISET.
% To load those data we first determine the wavelength samples for this sensor.
wave = sensorGet(sensor,'wave');

% Then we load the calibration data and attach them to the sensor structure
fullFileName = fullfile(isetRootPath,'data','sensor','colorfilters','nikon','NikonD100.mat');
[data,filterNames] = ieReadColorFilter(wave,fullFileName); 
sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'filter spectra',data);
sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'filter names',filterNames);
sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'Name','Camera-Simulation');

% We are now ready to compute the sensor image
sensor = sensorCompute(sensor,oi);

% We can view sensor image in the GUI.  Note that the image that comes up
% shows the color of each pixel in the sensor mosaic. Also, please be aware
% that the Matlab rendering algorithm often introduces unwanted artifacts
% into the display window.  You can resize the window to eliminate these.
% You can also set the display gamma function to brighten the appearance in
% the edit box at the lower left of the window.
sensorWindow(sensor);

% There are a variety of ways to quantify these data in the pulldown menus.
% Also, you can view the individual pixel data either by zooming on the
% image (Edit | Zoom) or by bringing the image viewer tool (Edit | Viewer).
%
% Type 'help iexL2ColorFilter' to find out how to convert data from an
% Excel Spread Sheet to an ISET color filter file or a spectral file/
%
% ISET includes a wide array of options for selecting color filters,
% fill-factors, infrared blocking filters, adjusting pixel properties,
% color filter array patterns, and exposure modes. 
%% Image Processor
% The sensor array is demosaiced, color-balanced, and rendered on a display
% The image processing pipeline is managed by the fourth principal ISET
% structure, the virtual camera image (vci).  This structure allows the
% user to set a variety of image processing methods, including demosaicking
% and color balancing.  
vci = ipCreate;

% The routines for setting and getting image processing parameters are
% ipGet and ipSet.
%
vci = ipSet(vci,'name','Unbalanced');
vci = ipSet(vci,'scaledisplay',1);

% The default properties use bilinear demosaicking, no color conversion or
% balancing.  The sensor RGB values are simply set to the display RGB
% values.
vci = ipCompute(vci,sensor);

% As in the other cases, we can bring up a window to view the processed
% data, this time a full RGB image.
ipWindow(vci);

% You can experiment by changing the processing parameters in many ways,
% such as:
vci2 = ipSet(vci,'name','More Balanced');
vci2 = ipSet(vci2,'internalCS','XYZ');
vci2 = ipSet(vci2,'conversion method sensor','MCC Optimized');
vci2 = ipSet(vci2,'illuminant correction method','Gray World');

% With these parameters, the colors will appear to be more accurate
vci2 = ipCompute(vci2,sensor);

ipWindow(vci2);

% Again, this window offers the opportunity to perform many parameter
% changes and to evaluate certain metric properties of the current system.
% Try the pulldown menu item (Analyze | Create Slanted Bar) and then run
% the pulldown menu (Analyze | ISO12233) to obtain a spatial frequency
% response function for the slanted bar image in the ISO standard.
