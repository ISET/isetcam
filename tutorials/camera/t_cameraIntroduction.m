% We are introducing a new object, the camera.  The camera object is a
% structure that includes the oi, sensor, and ip objects. 
%
% The camera object allows the user to run calculate more efficiently than
% addressing each object separately.  In the first part of this tutorial,
% we illustrate and compare the two ways of interacting:  with the separate
% objects, individually or with the camera object.
%
% This script explains the creation, set/get, and compute with the camera
% object.

%% Clean up the work space, if you like
ieInit

%% The camera object is created like all other ISET objects

% When you create the camera, you are provided with a default set of
% parameters for the optics (oi), sensor, and image processing (ip)
% objects.  The camera object is a structure that includes the oi,
% sensor, and ip objects.
camera = cameraCreate;

% As we show below, it is also possible to create a camera from the
% currently selected oi, sensor, and ip objects.  That relies on the
% command cameraCreate('current'), which we illustrate below.

%% Compute the camera output for a scene

% Create a simple scene
scene = sceneCreate;
scene = sceneSet(scene,'fov',8);

% Compute the camera output.  This combines the scene with the default
% camera that we created above.
camera = cameraCompute(camera,scene);

% Camera compute always adjusts the sensor size to make it match the field
% of view of the scene.  You are alerted to this by a warning.

%% Visualizing the camera objects

% To see all of the objects and their parameters listed their windows, you
% can use 
cameraWindow(camera,'oi');
cameraWindow(camera,'sensor');
cameraWindow(camera,'ip');

%% Retrieving specific camera object data

% There are two ways to retrieve data from the camera objects.  The slow
% but thorough way is to get the object and use the gets/sets and so forth
% specific to that object, such as
ip     = cameraGet(camera,'ip');
sRGB   = ipGet(ip,'data srgb');

% Have a look at the data, rendered for an sRGB monitor 
% Hopefully the one you are looking at is close to that.
vcNewGraphWin;
imagesc(sRGB);

% A more efficient alternative way is get the data from the camera object.
% The code is shorter, but it may be less transparent for new users.
sRGB = cameraGet(camera,'ip data srgb');
vcNewGraphWin;
imagesc(sRGB);


%% Setting the camera parameters

% A detailed way to set the object properties, such as the optics fnumber,
% is to retrieve the object, the set property, and reattach the object.
% For example, 

% Set the value
camera = cameraSet(camera,'optics fnumber',16);

% Compute, get the result, and show
camera = cameraCompute(camera,scene);

% Now get the image processor sRGB values and display them.
ip     = cameraGet(camera,'ip');
sRGB   = ipGet(ip,'data srgb');
ieNewGraphWin;
imagesc(sRGB);

%% Adjust the illuminant correction to gray world

% From here on out, we only illustrate the shorter list of commands based
% on the camera object.  In each case, it is possible to pull out the
% object and perform the actions on the object rather than through the
% camera.
camera = cameraSet(camera,'ip illuminant correction method','gray world');
camera = cameraCompute(camera,scene);
sRGB   = cameraGet(camera,'ip data srgb');

% Have a look at the data, rendered for an sRGB monitor 
ieNewGraphWin;
imagesc(sRGB);

%% To speed up the calculation, start from the computed optical image.

fprintf('The whole computation\n');
tic, cameraCompute(camera,scene); toc

fprintf('From the oi\n');
tic, cameraCompute(camera,'oi'); toc

fprintf('From the sensor\n');
tic, cameraCompute(camera,'sensor'); toc

cameraWindow(camera,'ip');
