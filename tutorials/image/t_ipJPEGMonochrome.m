%% JPEG compression of a grayscale image

% Let's read in a picture to get started
%
D = load('jpegFiles/einstein.mat');
im = D.X;   % Read in as the variable X
vcNewGraphWin;
imshow(im,[1,256])
title('Original Image Data');

% We are ready to start the compression operations.

% 1.  THE DCT STEP
%
% The first step is dividing the image into little 8x8 blocks,
% and then apply the DCT transformation on each block.  The image
% size is 256x256, these are multiples of 8, so we are in good
% shape.  If we had not had a multiple of 8, then we would have
% taken the last, incomplete block and padded it with zeros.

% To understand the calculation we will first trace what happens
% to a single block. Here is an 8x8 block from the image

block = im(89:96, 105:112)
vcNewGraphWin; histogram(block(:))
title('Histogram of 8x8 block near image center');
xlabel('Pixel value');
ylabel('Count');

% To transform the data in the block, we need to multiply them by
% the cos(x)cos(y) functions of the DCT.  I have stored these
% functions in a file that we can load.  To see how these
% functions are built use
% typejpegFiles/makeDctMatrix.m

load jpegFiles/dctMatrix;

% Each column of this matrix is a cos function at a different
% spatial frequency.  But they are very coarsely sampled and so
% they don't really look familiar.
%
plot(1:size(dctMatrix,1),dctMatrix(:,[1 3 5 7]))
title('Selected DCT basis functions');

% The DCT is separable, so to obtain the dct coefficients for
% this block we can perform a fairly simple matrix multiplication.
% We multiply the columns of the block by the dctMatrix and then
% we multiply the rows.
dctCoef = dctMatrix*block*dctMatrix';
histogram(dctCoef(:))
title('DCT coefficient histogram')

% Here is an image of the coefficients.  We use a nonlinear map
% so that the appearance of the blocks will correspond a little
% better with their actual values.
linMap = gray(256).^0.45;
vcNewGraphWin; colormap(linMap); imagesc(dctCoef);
title('DCT-transformed image data');

% Gray values represent coefficients near zero.  Bright values
% (upper left, the mean) are positive and black values are
% negative.  Notice that the higher order coefficients (lower
% right) are small. They tend to be small in general.

% If we use the DCT function in Matlab to do it, the results are
% the same, except for some extra scaling that is required for
% the JPEG standard.
%
% c = [ 1/sqrt(2) 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ];
% dctCoef1 = dct(block)'*diag(c)/8;      % apply dct on columns
% dctCoefm = dct(dctCoef1)'*diag(c)/8;   % apply dct on rows
%
% max(abs(dctCoefm(:) - dctCoef(:)))     % results are the same

%%THE QUANTIZATION STEP.
%
% We started with 64 numbers and we still have 64 numbers.  We
% are ready to save information by the quantization step. To
% quantize the dct coefficients, we divide each DCT coefficient
% by its quantization step size, round the result, and then
% multiply with the quantization step size.

% There is a standard quantization table provided by the JPEG
% people.  The one that is hard coded into the C-code is returned
% when you set the quality factor equal to 50.
Q_factor = 50;
q1 = jpeg_qtables(Q_factor,1)

% Big numbers in this table are places where the dct coefficients
% will be strongly quantized.  Small numbers, at the low
% frequency coefficients, will not be quantized as much.
% Notice, that with this default everything is quantized a
% little.  If we want a really high quality factor, look at what
% happens to the table.  Compare it with the previous one.
Q_factor = 90;
q1 = jpeg_qtables(Q_factor,1)

% To make the picture of the quantization table, I have made
% light mean preserve the coefficient and black mean lose it
colormap(linMap);

Q_factor = 80;
subplot(1,2,1); imagesc(256 -jpeg_qtables(Q_factor,1));
title(sprintf('Luminance quantization table for Q=%d',Q_factor));
axis image

Q_factor = 20;
subplot(1,2,2); imagesc(256 - jpeg_qtables(Q_factor,1));
title(sprintf('Luminance quantization table for Q=%d',Q_factor));
axis image

% Now we use the quantization table q1 to quantize the dct
% coefficients for the image block.
% First divide the coefficients by the quantization step size,
% then round, then multiply it back in.

dctQuant = round(dctCoef ./ q1) .* q1

% Notice, there are a lot of zeros in the quantized coefficient
% matrix.  This is good for the lossless compression stage that follows.

% The difference between the original dct coefficient and the
% quantized coefficient will not be larger than quantization step
% size.  We can check this as follows.
%
round(abs(dctQuant - dctCoef))


% Now we will transform-quantize over every block in the image.
% We always work with even blocks, but if the size of the image
% doesn't fill up a block at the edge, we pad the block with zeros.
Q_factor = 50;
q1 = jpeg_qtables(Q_factor,1)
dctQuant = zeros(size(im));
for i=1:8:size(im,1)
    for j=1:8:size(im,2)
        block = im(i:i+7, j:j+7);
        dctCoef = dctMatrix*block*dctMatrix';
        dctQuant(i:i+7, j:j+7) = round(dctCoef ./ q1) .* q1;
    end
end

% Notice that the quantized coefficients are really concentrated
% at a few levels, particularly zero. This makes themm very easy
% to compress.
%
vcNewGraphWin; histogram(dctQuant(:),[-100:5:256])
title('Histogram for DCT image after quantization');
xlabel('Value');ylabel('Count');


%% JPEG decoding

% Now we decode the stored quantized JPEG coefficients to get
% back an image.  To do this, we just need to invert the dct
% transformation. Again, we apply the decoding step to one 8x8
% block first to give you an idea of how it works.
%
block = im(89:96, 105:112);
blockdct = dctQuant(89:96, 105:112);
blockjpeg = idctMatrix*blockdct*idctMatrix';

% Here are the differences between the original and compressed
% block
round(blockjpeg) - block

% And here is a picture of the two blocks
vcNewGraphWin; colormap(linMap)
subplot(1,2,1); imagesc(block), axis image, title('Original')
subplot(1,2,2); imagesc(blockjpeg), axis image, title('Compressed')

% You can see that the reconstructed image intensities are spread
% out again, but not as spread out as the original.
vcNewGraphWin;
subplot(1,2,1); histogram(block(:)); title('Original')
subplot(1,2,2); histogram(blockjpeg(:)); title('Compressed')

% If we use the IDCT function in Matlab, the results should be
% the same:
% c = [ 1/sqrt(2) 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ];
% blockjpeg1 = idct((blockdct*inv(diag(c))*8)');
% blockjpegm = idct((blockjpeg1*inv(diag(c))*8)');
% max(abs(blockjpegm(:) - blockjpeg(:)))

% Now we decode the whole image.
%
imjpeg = zeros(size(im));
for i=1:8:size(im,1)
    for j=1:8:size(im,2)
        block = dctQuant(i:i+7, j:j+7);
        imjpeg(i:i+7, j:j+7) = idctMatrix*block*idctMatrix';
    end
end

% The result of inverse DCT transform is not guarranteed to be
% within the [0 255] range, so we truncate it.
imjpeg = round(truncate(imjpeg, 0, 255));

% Now, let's see how well we did.
vcNewGraphWin;
imshow(imjpeg, gray(256));

% We can repeat this whole set of operations using this function
% we wrote, jpegCompress, but with a quality factor that makes
% the artifacts very visible.

vcNewGraphWin;
Q_factor = 30;
q1 = jpeg_qtables(Q_factor,1)
imjpeg2 = jpegCompress(im, q1);
imjpeg2 = truncate(imjpeg2, 0, 255);
imshow(imjpeg2, gray(256));

%% BEGIN TUTORIAL QUESTIONS

% Question 1: JPEG COMPRESSION OF GRAYSCALE IMAGE
%
% a) Describe the initial steps (the steps prior to quantization) in the
% JPEG-DCT computation in terms of convolution followed by sampling.
%
% b) At what point is information lost in the JPEG-DCT computation?
%
% c) Why is it better to quantize the JPEG-DCT coefficients rather than
% the intensities of individual pixels?
%
% d) Suppose you use a JPEG-DCT compressor to compress an image
% (yielding image a); then you uncompress the image and compress it
% again using the same compressor and compression settings (yielding
% image b). How will the two compressed images (a and b) compare?  Explain.
%
% e) What are the main visual artifacts present in JPEG-DCT compressed
% grayscale image?  What types of images will display artifacting most
% visibly?
%
% Question 2:
%
% Read the einstein.mat image, and compress it using JPEG quantization
% levels of 75, 50, 25, and 0.  You may want to use the imread and imwrite
% functions to accomplish this.  Normalize all images to have intensities
% from 0 to 1 (as opposed to 0 to 255).
%
% a) Submit the squared-error image for q=25.
%
% b) Describe where the error image has the highest values.  Does this
% agree with your understanding of the JPEG-DCT algorithm?
%
% c) For each compressed image, compute the mean squared error and plot the
% error vs. quantization factor. [You may obtain data for more quantization
% settings if you like, but this is not required.]
%
% d) For each error image, compute the 95th percentile error point.  If
% your error image is called errorim, you can find this value as follows:
%
%    serr = sort(errorim(:)); % sort the error values
%    error95 = serr( floor(0.95 * length(serr)) ); % get the 95th percentile
%
% Also plot error vs quantization factor for this method.
%
% e) If you were evaluating image quality for this image, which method
% (c) or (d) would you use?  Describe why you would use this method.
