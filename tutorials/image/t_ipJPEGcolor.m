% We integrate the basic DCT calculations with color

% discussion of chrominance subsampling and color lookup tables.
% Finally, we try a simple experiment with jpeg compression by
% switching the luminance and chrominance quantization tables.

%% JPEG compression of color image

% Load in a color image.  This is an indexed color image.

D = load('jpegFiles/clown.mat');
map = D.map;
img = D.X;
vcNewGraphWin;
imshow(img, map);

% Convert the image into RGB format.
%
[r,g,b] = ind2rgb(img, map);

% Recall that JPEG works on each color plane separately.  Hence,
% in principle it is possible to apply JPEG to each of these
% three color planes separately.
%
qFactor = 75;
rCoef = jpegCoef(r,qFactor);
gCoef = jpegCoef(g,qFactor);
bCoef = jpegCoef(b,qFactor);

% You can see that we did well in terms of zeroing lots of the
% coefficients so that the result will be strongly compressed.
%
histogram(bCoef(:),[-100:10:260])
title('Histogram of quantized coefficients (b channel)');

% To prove this, let's just consider some of the sizes of things.
% This isn't exactly fair or precise, but we can get a rough idea
% of how compressible the different image data sets are by
% writing them out as matlab files and then measuring their entropy, or
% just by trying to compress them.

% (technical note: -v4 forces Matlab to save with no compression and
%  not to optimize by changing to a lower-precision data type even
%  if possible.)

save -v4 rgbImage r g b;
save -v4 dctCoef rCoef gCoef bCoef;

% We now measure the mathematical entropy of each file.  Entropy can be
% interpreted as a measure of the theoretical limit on the compressibility
% of data.  A lower entropy means that the data is more compressible.

rgbEntropy = entropy_file('rgbImage.mat')
dctEntropy = entropy_file('dctCoef.mat')

% If you're not convinced, or you're not familiar with entropy, You might
% also try running these commands, which, in Matlab v7, saves the
% data in a (lossless) compressed format to see how compressible the data
% is.
% save rgbImageComp r g b;
% save dctCoefComp  rCoef gCoef bCoef;


% Clean up and go back
%
unix('rm -f dctCoef* rgbImage*');

% Now, we will invert the coefficients and see what the image
% looks like.
rJPEG = truncate(jpegRGB(rCoef,qFactor),0,255);
gJPEG = truncate(jpegRGB(gCoef,qFactor),0,255);
bJPEG = truncate(jpegRGB(bCoef,qFactor),0,255);

% foo = jpegRGB(rCoef,q1); histogram(foo(:))
% histogram(rJPEG(:))
Xjpeg(:,:,1) = rJPEG; Xjpeg(:,:,2) = gJPEG; Xjpeg(:,:,3) = bJPEG;
imshow(Xjpeg/255);

% In the JPEG_bw tutorial, we showed you the quantization tables for the
% luminance plane.  In addition to the quantization matrices for the
% luminance plane, there there is also a quantization matrix for the
% chrominance plane.  As you can see, the standard chrominance table is
% very coarse for color.

% For these pictures of the quantization table, lighter means that the
% coefficients will be better preserved, and dark means that the
% coefficients will be more highly quantized.

Q_factor = 50;
q2 = jpeg_qtables(Q_factor,2)
vcNewGraphWin;
colormap(gray(64));

% Again, if you want to know how the scaling of quantization tables was
% done, look at the code in jpeg_qtables.

%%  JPEG Color spaces:  YCbCr

% Because the eye is insensitive to fine chromatic contrasts, we
% can compress the chromatic components of an image more than the
% light-dark component without much change in the image quality.
% In JPEG this is accomplished by transforming the RGB signals
% into a new color representation, commonly called Y,Cb,Cr, and
% then compressing the chromatic components (Cb,Cr) more than the
% luminance component (Y).

% In principle, you  might imagine that the standard would take
% into account the actual display you are using.  But, no.  Also,
% in principle, you would imagine that the standard might work in
% a space that reflected light intensity rather than frame
% buffers.  But, no.

% Rather, the transformation from RGB to YCbCr is hardcoded into
% a matrix

RGB2YCC = ...
    [ 0.2990 0.5870  0.1140; ...
    -0.1687 -0.3313 0.5000; ...
    0.5000 -0.4187 -0.0813]

% To apply this transformation to the r,g,b image data we do
%
Y =   0.2990*r + 0.5870*g + 0.1140*b;
Cb = -0.1687*r - 0.3313*g + 0.5000*b;
Cr =  0.5000*r - 0.4187*g - 0.0813*b;

% Now, we compute the coefficients of the Y image using a
% different quantization table from the Cb and Cr images.  In
% fact, the JPEG-DCT has two default quantization tables: one for
% the luminance component (Y),
qFactor = 75;
q1 = jpeg_qtables(qFactor, 1)

% and the other for the chrominance components (Cb, Cr).
%
q2 = jpeg_qtables(qFactor, 2)

% In general, the chrominance quantization table has larger
% quantization steps sizes than the luminance one.  Also, it is
% applied to THE SUBSAMPLED chrominance bands.  This saves a
% great deal of space.  At this moment, this is not implemented
% in this tutorial, so we will simply use

q2 = q1;

% Now we compress the clown image using these quantization
% tables.
Ycoef  = jpegCoef(Y, q1);
Cbcoef = jpegCoef(Cb,q2);
Crcoef = jpegCoef(Cr,q2);

% histogram(Ycoef(:),[-100:10:200])
% histogram(Cbcoef(:),[-100:10:200])

yJPEG   = jpegRGB(Ycoef,q1);
CbJPEG  = jpegRGB(Cbcoef,q2);
CrJPEG  = jpegRGB(Crcoef,q2);

% histogram(yJPEG(:))

% Convert the compressed YCbCr image back into RGB format
rJPEG = truncate(yJPEG + 1.4020*CrJPEG,0,255);
gJPEG = truncate(yJPEG - 0.3441*CbJPEG - 0.7141*CrJPEG,0,255);
bJPEG = truncate(yJPEG + 1.7720*CbJPEG - 0.0001*CrJPEG,0,255);

% histogram(rJPEG(:),[-100:5:200])
Xjpeg(:,:,1) = rJPEG; Xjpeg(:,:,2) = gJPEG; Xjpeg(:,:,3) = bJPEG;
vcNewGraphWin; imshow(Xjpeg/255);

% Remember: In the usual JPEG implementation, the chromatic
% planes (Cb,Cr) are subsampled by a factor of 2 before applying
% the DCT.  This reduces the representation allocated to the
% chromatic planes and saves lots more space.  It also changes
% the meaning of the spatial frequencies in the q2 quantization
% table.  All of this should be implemented as part of this
% tutorial some day.

%% BEGIN TUTORIAL QUESTIONS
%
% 1) Describe the information content of each channel of the YCbCr color
% space, in terms of what image properties the channels convey.
%
% 2) What property of color visual sensitivity makes it possible to obtain
% the high compression ratio if we accept lossy compression? How does the
% YCbCr color space take advantage of this visual system property?
%
% 3)  Explore the visual impact of compressing color images in different
% spaces.  Specifically, load a color image into R,G and B planes.  Then
% make a version of the image in YCbCr space, using the linear
% transformation above.
%
%   a)  Use the code from the tutorial to create a very aggressive
%   quantization table. Use this table and compress the blue channel a lot.
%   Then show the RGB image with the compressed blue channel.  (Quantize
%   the other two channels with a q factor of 75.)
%
%   Reconstruct and show the result.  Describe what you see.
%
%   b) Use the same quantization tables to aggressively compress the Cb
%   channel.  Reconstruct the image as in the tutorial, and show it. Which
%   image looks better?  (Quantize the other two channels with a q factor
%   of 75.)
%
%   Reconstruct and show the results.  Describe what you see.
%
%   c) To see what the different channels look like, try reconstructing
%   an image with the CbJPEG set to zero.  Then try it with the CrJPEG set
%   to zero.  Then try setting the Y channel to all values of 128.  This
%   is a picture with no luminance, only chrominance.
%
% Bonus Question:
%
%  In the Color Matching tutorial, we investigated the implications of
%  adding a fourth phosphor (ie, channel) to our color monitor.
%
%  Assume that the JPEG color gamut is a smaller subset of the visible
%  gamut, and that the gamut of the three-primary monitor is itself a
%  smaller subset of the JPEG gamut.
%
%  In the color matching tutorial, we noted that the the fourth monitor
%  primary allowed us to cover a larger area of the visible gamut.
%  a) Does the fourth primary help in the display of the JPEG image?
%
%  b) How would you modify JPEG to take full advantage of the new primary?
%  Describe how your modification helps, and also any extra data costs.
% (Extra bonus: modify the standard without any extra data costs)
