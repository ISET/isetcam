%% Examine  properties of the CIELAB color metric.
% This metric is designed to help predict the discriminability between
% spatially uniform targets.

% Let's assume we have a set of gray surfaces whose reflectance
% functions are linearly scaled with respect to one another.
wavelength = 400:700;
graySurfaces = ones(length(wavelength),10)*diag([.1:.1:1]);

vcNewGraphWin;
plot(wavelength,graySurfaces)
set(gca,'xlim',[350 750]);
xlabel('wavelength (nm)'); ylabel('Reflectance')
title('Spectral Reflectance of 10 Gray Surfaces');

%% Load a light source.
% D65 refers to the color temperature, namely 6500 deg Kelvin.  This is a
% slightly bluish appearing light source.

lgt = ieReadSpectra('D65',wavelength);

% Illuminate the surfaces with the light source and plot the
% resulting scattered light
%
graySPD = diag(lgt)*graySurfaces;

vcNewGraphWin;
plot(wavelength,graySPD)
set(gca,'xlim',[350 750]);
xlabel('wavelength (nm)'); ylabel('Relative intensity')
title('Spectral power distribution of light reflected from gray surfaces');

%% Compute their XYZ values
XYZ = ieReadSpectra('XYZ',wavelength);
grayXYZ = XYZ'*graySPD

% Remember:  the Y value of a white surface is always 100, so we
% must scale the results by the Y value of the white surface,
% appropriately.  The second row is Y, and the tenth surface is white.

grayXYZ = grayXYZ * 100 / grayXYZ(2,10)

% To compute the CIELAB values, we will need to use the XYZ values
% of the white surface.  So, let's save them in a special
% variable.

whiteXYZ = grayXYZ(:,10)

% Notice that the Y values of these 10 surfaces are linearly
% spaced.  That is because Y is a linear computation from the
% SPD.  The X and Z values are linear, too (not shown).

%%
vcNewGraphWin;
plot(1:10, grayXYZ(2,:),'o',1:10,grayXYZ(2,:),'-')
xlabel('Surface number'); ylabel('Y value')
title('Y values of linearly-spaced reflectances');

%% Here are the gray surfaces plotted in the 3-dimensional XYZ color space:
vcNewGraphWin;
plot3(grayXYZ(1,:), grayXYZ(2,:), grayXYZ(3,:),'o',...
    grayXYZ(1,:), grayXYZ(2,:), grayXYZ(3,:),'-');
xlabel('X'); ylabel('Y'); zlabel('Z');
title('Linearly-spaced gray reflectances in XYZ color space');
grid on;

%% Convert these values to LAB values.
% We call the routine ieieXYZ2LAB.  You should take a look at the routine to
% see what it does by invoking "type ieieXYZ2LAB"

grayLAB = ieXYZ2LAB( grayXYZ.', whiteXYZ.' ).'

% Let's plot the L* values of these gray surfaces.  This set of values is
% not linearly related to the surface reflectance functions.  Rather, they
% are related by a cube root function.
vcNewGraphWin;
plot(1:10,grayLAB(1,:),'o',1:10,grayLAB(1,:),'-');
xlabel('Surface number');ylabel('L* value')
title('L* values of surfaces with linearly-spaced reflectances');

%% Plot in 3 dimensions for LAB space.
% Notice that the a* and b* coordinates are zero for the gray series.
vcNewGraphWin;
plot3(grayLAB(2,:), grayLAB(3,:), grayLAB(1,:),'o',...
    grayLAB(2,:), grayLAB(3,:), grayLAB(1,:),'-');
xlabel('a*'); ylabel('b*'); zlabel('L*');
title('Linearly-spaced gray reflectances in LAB color space');
grid on; axis([ -10 10 -10 10 0 100]);

%% Examine the chromaticity coordinates of these various surfaces.
% Remember that the chromaticity coordinates represent only two of the
% three dimensions.  In this case, the surfaces all share a common "shape"
% spectral power distribution, and they differ only by a scale factor.  So
% the surfaces will have the same chromaticity coordinates.
grayxy = chromaticity(grayXYZ')'

%%  Creating and rendering the Lab values

% The a* and b* describe aspects of the hue and saturation of the
% targets For the gray series, the values of a* and b* (the 2nd
% and third rows of grayLAB) are all near zero.  Next, we use the
% methods we developed in the ColorMatching tutorial to create
% new Lab values and render them on the screen.
%

% Let's make a list of Lab values that are the same as the gray
% values, but that systematically vary the a* range.
%

nChips = size(grayLAB,2);
aRamp = ieScale(1:nChips,-30,30);
varyAstarLAB = zeros([3, nChips]);
varyAstarLAB(1,:) = 70;    % L
varyAstarLAB(2,:) = aRamp; % A = linear ramp
varyAstarLAB(3,:) = 0;
varyAstarLAB

% To see what these Lab values look like, we will (a) convert the Lab
% values into XYZ values, (b) guess about your screen primary spectral
% power distributions and gamma to render these XYZ values.  The techniques
% we use here are the same as in the ColorMatching.m tutorial.

% First, use this function to invert the LAB values to XYZ
% values.  Notice that we need to know the white point, whiteXYZ.

varyXYZ = ieLAB2XYZ(varyAstarLAB',whiteXYZ)'

% Stop for just a moment to see how varying the value of a*
% changes the chromaticity values.  Using the XYZ values, we can
% calculate the chromaticity values.  Notice that as we vary a*
% the chromaticity values move along a simple path.
varyxy = chromaticity(varyXYZ')';

%% Some plots
vcNewGraphWin;
plot(varyxy(1,:),varyxy(2,:),'o'); hold on
xlabel('x-chromaticity'),ylabel('y-chromaticity')
title('xy chromaticity of the A* color series');

% Let's see where the chromaticity point of white is.
whitexy = chromaticity(whiteXYZ')'
vcNewGraphWin;
plot(whitexy(1),whitexy(2),'k*'); hold off

%% Render these XYZ values.
% We must load up some calibration information about your monitor.  Because
% I have no idea what monitor you are using -- this is a general problem
% for the industry -- I am going to just make a guess and use a standard
% set of monitor values.
d = displayCreate('LCD-Apple','wave',wavelength);

% Now, compute the transformations from XYZ to linear rgb and
% back for this monitor
rgb2xyz = displayGet(d,'rgb2xyz');  % Display primary spectral power distribution
xyz2rgb = inv(rgb2xyz);

%% Compute the linear rgb values for the collection of
% surface colors we have designed.  There is a free scalar in the
% calculation corresponding to the intensity of the light
% source. Because white is the maximum value, let's scale the
% color map entries so that the linear rgb values for white are
% all within range (i.e., less than 1.0).

whiteRGB = (xyz2rgb*whiteXYZ)'
whiteMax = max(whiteRGB)

varyRGB = (xyz2rgb*varyXYZ);
varyRGB = varyRGB/whiteMax;

% Use the routine:
invGamTable = displayGet(d,'inverse gamma',1000);
relativeIntensity = (1:length(invGamTable))/length(invGamTable);

%% Have a look
vcNewGraphWin;
plot(relativeIntensity,invGamTable)
xlabel('Intensity (relative)'); ylabel('Digital value')
title('Gamma Table');
grid on


%% Show examples of LAB varying images

% There are some simple tools for creating images on a standard display
% (sRGB).
%
% First put the varyXYZ (Astar varied) values a 3D array
varyXYZ = ieLAB2XYZ(varyAstarLAB',whiteXYZ)'
fbRGB = xyz2srgb(XW2RGBFormat(varyXYZ',nChips,1))
vcNewGraphWin;
image(fbRGB)
title('Image of A* Ramp (approximate)');
axis off

% Let's make a similar picture as we vary the b* dimension.
% Because we have various bits of information loaded up already
% we can compute a little more quickly.

%% Create the varyBstar values
%
varyBstar(1,:) = 70*ones(1,nChips); % L
varyBstar(2,:) = zeros(1,nChips);   % A*
varyBstar(3,:) = aRamp;             % B*

% Convert Lab to XYZ values
varyXYZ = ieLAB2XYZ(varyBstar',whiteXYZ)'
fbRGB = xyz2srgb(XW2RGBFormat(varyXYZ',nChips,1))
image(fbRGB)
title('Image of B* Ramp (approximate)');
axis off

% By the way: do you see a visual illusion in these images?  The regions
% near the edges (the stimulus is constant) are called colored Mach Bands.

%% The Delta E_ab value

% A central purpose in creating the CIELAB Metric is to be able
% to measure the perceived difference between pairs of lights
% (when the lights are not too dissimilar).

% Create a simple XYZ difference.  Specifically, this difference is 5
% units of Y.  We will add this difference into all of the gray series.
% Notice that we add the same difference to every one of the gray chips.
deltaXYZ = zeros(size(grayXYZ));
deltaXYZ(2,:) = (whiteXYZ(2)/20);
deltaXYZ

% Measure the Lab differences between the original grayXYZ and these
% values with the constant difference (deltaXYZ) added into each gray chip.
%
lab1 = ieXYZ2LAB( grayXYZ.', whiteXYZ.' ).';
lab2 = ieXYZ2LAB( ( grayXYZ + deltaXYZ ).', whiteXYZ.' ).';
diffLAB = lab1 - lab2;

% To see the LAB values in three space for the grayXYZ series and the one
% separated by deltaXYZ, use this code.  It shows the series of LAB values
% of the two different sets, separated by a constant difference.
%
vcNewGraphWin; plot3(lab1(2,:),lab1(3,:),lab1(1,:),'-o',...
    lab2(2,:),lab2(3,:),lab2(1,:),'-*')

for ii=1:size(lab1,2);
    hold on;
    plot3([lab1(2,ii); lab2(2,ii)], ...   % A;egmoqs
        [lab1(3,ii); lab2(3,ii)], ... % B
        [lab1(1,ii); lab2(1,ii)], 'k--'); % L
end
hold off; grid on;
zlabel('L*'), xlabel('A*'); ylabel('B*')
title('LAB value of the equally spaced gray chips')
legend('Orig', 'Orig+diff', 'Location','NorthEast');

% Now we can compute the magnitude of these differences, which is
% called delta Eab.
%
nChips = size(grayXYZ,2)
for i=1:nChips
    dEab(i) = norm( diffLAB(:,i));
end

% Recall that the deltaXYZ is the same at all these levels.  But,
% the delta Eab varies because we are more sensitive at lower
% intensity levels than at high one.  So, the delta Eab value for
% at the dark chips is much larger than the delta Eab value
% for the light chips.
%
% (Note that this is a simplified version of the information
%  in the 3D plot above.)

%%% BEGIN TUTORIAL QUESTIONS --
%
% Question 1:
% Suppose you had to choose a set of gray reflectances that are equally
% spaced in LAB coordinates.  How would you choose the reflectance levels of the
% gray series?  Explain this qualitatively, based on the CIELAB metric
% formula (See Color Appearance Lecture Notes).
%
% Question 2:
% Is visual sensitivity greater for distinguishing the mean reflectance
% of dark surfaces or light surfaces?  Justify your answer using the CIELAB
% formula. (See Color Appearance Lecture Notes).
%
% Question 3:
% Suppose we measure the XYZ values of each of a pair of lights.
% According to the CIELAB metric, what other values must we measure before
% we can predict the discriminability of these lights?  What basic
% processes in the visual system do these other values represent?
%
% Question 4:
% Set the white point to whiteXYZ = [100,100,100];
% Consider the point pXYZ = [50,100,100];
% What is the delta E spacing between pXYZ and another point that differs
% by 5 units in each principal direction (e.g., [55,100,100])?
%
% Question 5: USING CIELAB TO COMPARE IMAGES
%
% Define the colors
%  yellowRGB = [1.0 1.0 0.0]
%  blueRGB = [0.25 0.625 1.0]
%  greenRGB = [0.625, 0.8125, 0.5]
%
% a) Compute the XYZ values for these colors when displayed on our
% standard (linear) monitor (i.e., ignore gamma correction).
%
% b) Compute the LAB values for these colors for a white point of
%    whiteXYZ = [95 100 108]
%
% Change the white point to whiteXYZ = [108 100 95] and compute the LAB
% values again. Does the white point have a big effect?  Does changing the
% white point have the same effect on L, a* and b*?
%
% c) Using the original white point whiteXYZ = [95 100 108], compute the
% delta E difference between each combination of the three colors
% (yellowRGB ...). Based on these results, which pair of colors is most
% dissimilar?
%
% d) Use the following code to generate three images imYB1, imYB2, and imG.
% (Do not submit these images, but you may describe what you see.)
%
%         imw = 128;
%         imYB1 = repmat(reshape(yellowRGB,1,1,3), [256 imw]);
%         ss = 1;
%         for ii = 1:ss
%             imYB1(ii:(2*ss):256, :, :) = ...
%                 repmat(reshape(blueRGB,1,1,3), [256/ss/2 imw]);
%         end
%         imYB2 = repmat(reshape(yellowRGB,1,1,3), [256 imw]);
%         ss = 16;
%         for ii = 1:ss
%             imYB2(ii:(2*ss):256, :, :) = ...
%                 repmat(reshape(blueRGB,1,1,3), [256/ss/2 imw]);
%         end
%
%         imG = repmat(reshape(greenRGB,1,1,3), [256, imw]);
%
% Measure the delta E difference between imYB1 and imG, and the difference
% between imYB2 and imG, and compare these values.  Define the difference
% between two images to be the average delta E difference across all
% pixels.  (Use the white point whiteXYZ = [95 100 108]).
%
% Hints:
% - You may find the command
%   imdata = reshape(im, size(im,1)*size(im,2),3);
% useful for transforming an m x n x 3 image into an (m*n) x 3 matrix of
% pixels.
%
% - You can use ieXYZ2LAB to convert XYZ data to LAB data in bulk.
% ieXYZ2LAB may take an nx3 matrix of XYZ values to LAB values
% (where each row is an XYZ color vector).
%
% e) View the images side by side and compare them.  Notice that the
% average delta E of (imYB1 vs imG) and of (imYB2 vs imG) do not agree
% with the appearance similarity. Explain why you think the appearance and
% delta E values diverge. Suggest a way to improve the CIELAB metric so it
% more accurately reflects the perceived difference.
