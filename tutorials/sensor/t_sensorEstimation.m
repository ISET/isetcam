% Tutorial introduces several color calculations that are relevant to
% camera and scanner calibration.  These calculations involve thinking
% about the sensors in the camer and scanner.  As you perform the
% calculations, you should consider the relationship between how the
% scanner or camera encode light, and how the eye encodes light. Also, part
% of the tutorial will involve computations with surface reflectances and
% illuminants that are relevant to the Rendering tutorial.
%

%% Surface Reflectance Functions
%
% The Macbeth Color Checker is a set of 24 surfaces commonly used to
% evaluate color balancing systems.  There is one in the ISEP lab.  The
% surfaces that make up the Color Checker were selected to have the same
% surface reflectance functions as various important surfaces that are
% commonly used in television and film images.  We will read in a matrix of
% data.  Each row of the matrix is the reflectance function of one of the
% Macbeth surfaces, measured at each of 361 wavelength samples in the
% visible spectrum.  (Most of the visible spectrum is in the 400-700
% nanometers wavelength region.)  Thus we get a 24x361 matrix of surface
% spectra. Each row is one surface.

% Load in the data representing the macbeth color checker surface
% reflectances.  The data are stored in the columns of the matrix.

wavelength = 400:10:700;
macbethChart = ieReadSpectra('macbethChart',wavelength);

% The different columns of this matrix represent various colored surfaces.
% The column numbers of some of the chips are

greenChip = 7; redChip = 11; whiteChip = 4; grayChip = 12;

% Let's look at the reflectance function of the green surface.

vcNewGraphWin;
plot(wavelength,macbethChart(:,greenChip),'g');grid on
xlabel('Wavelength (nm)');
ylabel('Surface Reflectance');
title('Reflectance of Macbeth Surfaces');

% Notice that about 18% of the light at wavelength 500 nm is
% reflected by the "Green" surface. Here is the reflectance
% function of a red surface:

hold on
plot(wavelength,macbethChart(:,redChip),'r');

% And here is a gray surface:

hold on
plot(wavelength,macbethChart(:,grayChip),'k');

hold off

%% Creating a spectral power distribution of scattered light
% This scattered light will be the signal encoded by
% the scanner.
%

% Now, load in an illuminant.  The illuminant spd represent the
% amount of light present at each wavelength.

D65 = ieReadSpectra('D65.mat',wavelength);

% Make a plot of D65 a standard illuminant which represents a mix of blue
% sky and clouds.

vcNewGraphWin;
plot(wavelength,D65,'b'); grid on
xlabel('Wavelength (nm)');
ylabel('Energy');
title('Energy spectrum of D65 Illimunant');

% The light scattered from the surface is the pointwise product of the
% incident light and the reflectance of the surface at the each wavelength.
% There are lots of ways to do this calculation, but I find it simple to
% perform it for all of the surfaces at once as a matrix product.
%
% First, we turn the spd of the light into a diagonal matrix, and then we
% multiply that matrix times the matrix whose columns contain the surface
% reflectance functions.

spectral_signals = diag(D65)*macbethChart;

% As examples, plot the spectral signal scattered from the green and
% gray  Macbeth surfaces.

plot(wavelength,spectral_signals(:,greenChip),'g'); hold on

%% Predicting device sensor responses to the light sources


% Now, we calculate the expected response from a linear sensor given a
% particular spectral signal.  The spectral responsivitiy of the r,g,b
% sensors in an HP Scanjet IIC I once calibrated are contained in this
% file.

sensors = ieReadSpectra('cMatch/camera', wavelength);
plot(wavelength(:), sensors); grid on
xlabel('Wavelength (nm)'); ylabel('Responsivity')

% Take a look at the spectral responsivities of these sensors. Notice that
% they hardly overlap.  This non-overlapping structure is due to  the way
% the device is built, using dichroic filters, and I will explain this in
% class.  Most significantly, notice that these sensors really don't look
% anything like the cone sensitivities of the human eye.

ncones = ieReadSpectra('SmithPokornyCones',wavelength);
vcNewGraphWin;
plot(wavelength(:),ncones);
grid on

%% PREDICTING SENSOR RESPONSES TO D65 REFLECTED FROM MACBETH CHART
%

% We can predict the (linear) sensor responses by a simple matrix
% multiplication. The matrix product of the sensor sensitivites (in the
% rows) and the spectral signals (in the columns) generates the response
% for each sensor class.

rgbResponses= sensors'*spectral_signals;
size(rgbResponses)

% Notice the size of the rgb matrix.  It is 3 by 24 because there are three
% types of sensors and 24 surfaces in the Macbeth Color Checker.

% We can plot the rgb responses of this scanner to the light scattered from
% the gray surfaces.  Before we create this plot, ask yourself what you
% think the values ought to be.

% In order of lightest to darkest, here are the gray surfaces.
graySeries = 4:4:24;

% And here is how to plot the predicted rgb responses
%
plot(graySeries,rgbResponses(1,graySeries)','ro', ...
    graySeries,rgbResponses(2,graySeries)','go', ...
    graySeries,rgbResponses(3,graySeries)','bo')

%% ESTIMATE THE SENSOR RESPONSIVITIES

% Suppose that we didn't know the spectral properties of the scanner.  How
% could we estimate the wavelength tuning of the sensors in the scanner by
% making a set of measurements? We might be able to measure the scanner
% illuminant directly, just by opening the box during the scan.  So,
% figuring out the illuminant should be pretty easy.

% Given the illuminant is known, how do we estimate the properties of the
% camera sensors?  We need to measure how the sensors respond to a
% calibrated target, like the Macbeth color-checker.  If we know the
% illuminant, then we can calculate the spectral signals arriving at the
% sensors.  We have calcuclated them already above as "spectral_signals."
% In general, we know that the rgbResponses are equal to

% rgbResponses = scanner'*spectral_signals

% Given that we know the spectral_signals and the rgbResponses and we want
% to estimate the scanner.  It might be helpful to draw a matrix tableau of
% what this equation represents.  You will see that there are more unknowns
% than there are linear equations. Hence, it is impossible to estimate the
% scanner sensitivity uniquely from these measurements.  But, we can
% measure that part of the scanner sensitivity that falls within the column
% space of the spectral signals.  We do this by calculating the
% "pseudo-inverse" of the matrix spectral_signals.

estimate = (rgbResponses*pinv(spectral_signals))';

plot(wavelength,estimate(:,1),'r', ...
    wavelength,estimate(:,2),'g', ...
    wavelength,estimate(:,3),'b')
grid on
xlabel('Wavelength'), ylabel('Responsivity')
title('Estimated sensor responses')

% Notice that even for this computational example, the estimates are not
% perfect: there are noticeable differences between them and the original
% sensors.  But, the estimated sensors predict the responses perfectly.

rgbPred = estimate'*spectral_signals;
plot(rgbPred(:),rgbResponses(:),'o')
grid on

% Suppose we had fewer measurements samples.  How well would we
% have done on the estimation?

l = 1:5:24;
estimate = (rgbResponses(:,l)*pinv(spectral_signals(:,l)))';

plot(wavelength,estimate(:,1),'r', ...
    wavelength,estimate(:,2),'g', ...
    wavelength,estimate(:,3),'b')
grid on

title('Estimated sensor responses')

% The new estimates are worse.  We might also ask how well the new
% estimates to in predicting the full set of responses, that is the
% responses to the surfaces not in the list, l.

rgbPred = estimate'*spectral_signals;
plot(rgbPred(:),rgbResponses(:),'o')
xlabel('Predicted rgb'); ylabel('Measured rgb');
grid on

% Try adding in some measurement noise to create a new estimate.
%
randn('seed',0);
n = 10*randn(size(rgbResponses));
sig = max(0,rgbResponses + n);
estimate = (sig(:,l)*pinv(spectral_signals(:,l)))';
