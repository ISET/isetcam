function t_wvfPupilSize
% Explore the effect of changing the pupil size in the calculation.
%
% Syntax:
%   t_wvfPupilSize
%
% Description:
%    We load the Thibos wavefront data for various pupil diamters and
%    caclulate and plot psfs for various other pupil diameters.
%
%    We then set the calculated pupil size and compute the expected
%    pointspread function. That function changes as the pupil diameter gets
%    smaller, and also varies a little with the measured size for a fixed
%    calculation size.
%
% Inputs:
%    None.
%
% Outputs:
%    None.
%
% Optional key/value pairs:
%    None.

%% Load the Thibos data for one of the measurd pupil diameter sizes
% Measured pupil size can be 7.5 6, 4.5, or 3 mm. Here we load the largest
% available size, so that we can vary the size of the calcualated pupil and
% see its effect. See below to examine the effect of measured pupil size.

% Create the wvf parameter structure with the appropriate values Be sure to
% set both measured pupil size and the pupil size for calculation. It's
% true that we'll vary it below, but initializing both explicitly is a good
% habit to get into.
%
% The calculated pupil size must be equal to or smaller than the measured
% pupil size.

%% Now fix the calcuated pupil size at 3 mm and vary the measured size.
% We are not sure whether the Thibos data contains measurements made of
% real eyes for different pupil sizes, or whether the measurements were
% made for the largest pupil size and then the Zernike coefficients
% computed from the measured pupil function over various diameters.
%
% In either case, in an idealized world, we think that the central (e.g.) 3
% mm of the pupil function would be the same no matter how large a pupil
% the measurements were made for. Measurement or calculation error could
% cause deviations from this prediction, however. We do find differences in
% the psfs computed for 3 mm from various measured pupil sizes, but they
% are not large.
%
% Here, each time through the loop, we load new zcoeffs according to the
% specified measurement pupil size.
