% Create human optics approximation and compare to Marimont & Wandell model
%
% Description:
%    Use the WVF methods to create an approximation to human optics in
%    isetbio, and compare to Marimont and Wandell model.
%
% Notes:
%    * [NOTE: DHB - The appearance of the two optical images is
%       surprisingly different. This should be expanded to compare the
%       PSFs, or something else, so that the tutorial makes clear why they
%       are so different.]
%

% History:
%    11/26/17  dhb  Simplify not to use wvfCreate (which didn't preserve
%                   lens density). Change name to t_ rather than s_.

%% Create wavefront for human eyes
% Note that averaging the coefficients to get the sample mean is not the
% same as finding optics for a typical human observer. Averaging the
% coefficients does not yield a PSF whose phase structure is like that of
% individual observers.  Nicolas Cottaris has analyzed this in some detail
% as part of the IBIOColorDetect project.
