%% Illustrate padding and cropping of the OI in ISETCam
%
% By default, ISETCam pads the OI to show the light that is spread beyond
% the edge of the scene.  The OI image is padded to be 1.25 times the field
% of view of the scene.
%
% We can crop that padded region with the code illustrated below.
%
% In the case of the sensor image, it is not necessary to crop.  You can
% set the sensor size so that its field of view matches the field of view
% of the original scene, and thus you will not measure the padded region.
% Or you can set the sensor FOV to be a little bit bigger.  Your choice,
% depending on what you are interested to do.
%
% NC introduced a useful and more general method based on the oiPadParams
% function in ISETBio. We should probably shift to that at some point in
% time.

ieInit

%% This will work for any scene, I think (BW).

scene = sceneCreate('sweep frequency');
oi = oiCreate;
oi = oiCompute(oi,scene);
oiWindow(oi);

%% Eliminate the default padding in the OI
%
% The oi has been padded by 1/8 the size of the original oi on both sides.
% That is the black region in the image.
%
%   paddedSize = (1.25 * originalSize)
%
%  To eliminate the padding we compute with oiCrop
%
paddedSize = oiGet(oi,'size');
originalSize = paddedSize/1.25;
offset = (paddedSize - originalSize) / 2;
rect = [offset(2)+1 offset(1)+1 originalSize(2)-1 originalSize(1)-1];
oiCropped = oiCrop(oi,rect);
oiWindow(oiCropped);

%% Notice that for sensors, you can crop just by setting the FOV

sensor = sensorCreate;
sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'fov',sceneGet(scene,'fov'),oi);

% The oi has the padding.  But the sensor is cropped
sensor = sensorCompute(sensor,oi);
sensorWindow(sensor);

%% So you will have the same result with the cropped oi

sensor = sensorCompute(sensor,oiCropped);
sensorWindow(sensor);

%%  Here is the padded image. 

% Notice, however, that the FOV is always the horizontal field of view, so
% we do not get padding in the vertical direction for a rectangular image.
% Only for a square image.
sensor = sensorSetSizeToFOV(sensor,oiGet(oi,'fov'),oi);
sensor = sensorCompute(sensor,oi);
sensorWindow(sensor);
