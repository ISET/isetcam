%% Tutorial describing the scene object
%
% *Description*
%
% ISETCam is structured around a few key objects that are important parts
% of the image acquisition pipeline. These are the *scene, optical image,
% sensor, and image processor*. This script introduces the first and
% simplest ISETCam object: a *scene* .
%
% A main goal of this script is to illustrate the ISETCam programming
% style. By using ISETCam objects properly, the code and analysis are much
% easier to understand. The implementation of these objects was written
% before Matlab implemented its classes and thus doesn't rely on that
% feature.
%
% But many of the principles are the same. For each object there are three
% fundamental operations: *Create, set parameters, and get* object
% parameters.
%
% The scene describes the spectral radiance field.  For the present
% tutorial we  work with a simple planar radiance image, such as the image
% on a display surface.  
%
% We have substantially extended ISETCam for implementations for 3D scenes
% in the github repository (iset3d).

ieInit

%% Create a scene and explore some of its features
% The create function initiates the object. Typically, there are many
% different initial formats. For the scene, the optics including color
% targets, patterns, charts, and images.

% ISET sceneCreate builds a number of predefined scenes
% You can see the range of possibilities by typing
%    
%  *help sceneCreate* , or
%  *doc sceneScreate*
%
% into the Matlab prompt.

% Create a scene: Here is a simple scene of a color chart
scene = sceneCreate('macbeth d65');

% To put the scene object into a window of the graphical user interface
% (GUI), first we use the command ISET that adds the scene to the ISET
% database:
ieAddObject(scene);

% Then we call the function sceneWindow which displays the object This call
% opens the  graphical interface and displays the current scene
sceneWindow;

% When the window appears, you can scale the window size and adjust the
% font size as well (Edit | Change Font Size). There are many other options
% in the pull down menus for cropping, transposing, and measuring scene
% properties.

% The command
%
%   sceneWindow(scene);
%
% is equivalent to 
%
%   ieAddObject(scene); sceneWindow;
%
%% The way to interact with an object is through gets and sets.
% For example, each object has a name and a type.
name  = sceneGet(scene,'name')

%% There are many other scene parameters you can get
% For example a scene has a horizontal field of view
hFOV = sceneGet(scene,'hfov')

%% Use sceneSet to change a scene property
scene = sceneSet(scene,'hfov',0.5);  % In degrees of visual angle

% Confirm that the set worked
hFOV  = sceneGet(scene,'hfov')

%% Philosophical interlude - programming issues
% There are always more parameters to "get" than are to "set".  This is
% because there are dependencies among any object parameters.  For example,
% if you know the image distance and horizontal field of view, you can
% compute the spatial sample spacing.
%
% In designing the sets/gets, the author must select an approach:  Do we
% allow the user to set anything and then update the other parameters for
% consistency, or do we only allow the user to set specific parameters and
% through this limitation enforce consistency.  ISET uses the 2nd method:
% Only some parameters can be set.
%
% That is why there are more gets than sets.  You can get parameters that
% depend on the sets.
%
% You can see the scene structure and its parameters simply by
% typing
scene
%% Use sets and gets to interact with ISET objects

% While the objects in ISET can be addressed directly - please don't.
% If you are ever tempted to set the objects directly, go get a cup of
% coffee.  When you come back, you will feel like using a sceneSet

% You can see the scene parameters you can set by typing
% help sceneSet
% For a nicer formatting, use the Matlab doc command
% For example, you might try
%   doc sceneGet
%   doc sceneSet

%% Explore the relationship between parameters

% To see an example of the dependence, consider the effect of scene
% distance, which we can get, on scene sample spacing.
dist    = sceneGet(scene,'distance','mm');
spacing = sceneGet(scene,'sample spacing','mm');
dist

% If we move the scene closer, and we maintain the same number of row and
% column samples, the spacing changes.
scene = sceneSet(scene,'distance',0.6);
sceneGet(scene,'sample spacing','mm');

%% Change the distance and horizontal field of view (hFOV)

% This will change the sample spacing as well.
scene = sceneSet(scene,'hfov',hFOV/2);
sceneGet(scene,'sample spacing','mm')

%% Specifying units

% In this example, we specified the units of the sample spacing as
% millimemters (mm). We could have specified microns.
sceneGet(scene,'sample spacing','um')
%%
% or we could have specified the return in meters.
sceneGet(scene,'sample spacing','m')

%% Creating a scene from a file

% ISET includes a few multispectral scenes.  These are large files, so the
% default distribution only includes one example.  We have another 100 or
% so that are available.

fname = fullfile(isetRootPath,'data','images','multispectral','StuffedAnimals_tungsten-hdrs.mat');
scene = sceneFromFile(fname,'multispectral');
sceneWindow(scene);
%% Plot scene properties

% Many scene properties that can be plotted either from the scene Window or
% using scenePlot. For example, ISET scenes specify a uniform illuminant by
% default.  You can plot the illuminant in energy units by this command.
scenePlot(scene,'illuminant energy');

% The scenePlot command above is equivalent to
%  wave = sceneGet(scene,'wave');
%  illuminant  = sceneGet(scene,'illuminant energy');
%  vcNewGraphWin; plot(wave,illuminant); grid on
%  xlabel('wave (nm)'); ylabel('Energy (watts/sr/nm/m^2)')
%

%% You can change the illumination's spectral power distribution

% In this case, we create a blackbody illuminant and reilluminate the
% scene.
bb = blackbody(sceneGet(scene,'wave'),6500,'energy');
scene = sceneAdjustIlluminant(scene,bb);
sceneWindow(scene);

%%  ISET keeps track of units

% In this case, we plot the illuminant in units of photons, rather than
% energy.
scenePlot(scene,'illuminant photons');
