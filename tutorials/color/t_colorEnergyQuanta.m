%% Show the wavelength dependency of the conversion from energy to photons

% We can calculate the energy for quanta at different wavelengths by
% setting up a vector of 1s to represent the photons and then calling
% function  Quanta2Energy
wave = 400:5:700;
photons = ones(length(wave),1);
E = Quanta2Energy(wave,photons);

% Notice that the amount of energy per photon declines with longer
% wavelengths.
vcNewGraphWin; plot(wave,E); grid on

%% The spectral power distribution (SPD) in energy and quanta

% This is a standard Daylight 6500 light source.  We read it and set its
% luminance to 100 cd/m2.
d65Energy = ieReadSpectra('D65.mat',wave);
d65XYZ    = ieXYZFromEnergy(d65Energy(:)',wave);
d65Energy = d65Energy*100/d65XYZ(2);

% Have a look at the SPD and note the energy levels
vcNewGraphWin; plot(wave,d65Energy); grid on
xlabel('Wavelength (nm)');ylabel('Energy (watts/sr/nm/m2)')

% Next, convert the light from energy units to photons.
d65Photons = Energy2Quanta(wave(:),d65Energy(:));

% Look at the number of photons emitted from the source per square meter
% and per steradian.  Notice that the overall shape of the curves differ
% with the fall off at longer wavelengths is more rapid for energy than for
% photons.  That is, the D65 light has about the same number of long
% (650nm) and middle (550nm) wavelength photons.  But there is more energy
% in the middle wavelength photons.

%% Energy, Photons, and the CIE XYZ functions

% The CIE 1931 standard curves for XYZ are defined assuming that the input
% signal is specified in terms of energy.
XYZEnergy = ieReadSpectra('XYZ',wave);
vcNewGraphWin;
subplot(1,2,1), plot(wave,XYZEnergy); grid on; title('XYZ standard (energy)');

% For good reasons, the ISET sensor calculations are based on a
% representation of the input signal in photons.  If you wish to use an XYZ
% filter on a sensor and want the output voltage to measure the XYZ value
% of a light, then the filter used by the sensor should expect the input
% signal to be defined in photons, not energy.  You can see how to adjust
% the filter by examining the ISET script, XYZQuanta.m.
% type XYZQuanta.m
XYZPhotons = ieReadSpectra('XYZQuanta',wave);
subplot(1,2,2), plot(wave,XYZPhotons); grid on; title('XYZ Photons')

%% Calculating XYZ for a D65 light

% We read a standard light (Daylight 6500 K) and scale it to have a
% luminance of 100 cd/m2.
d65Energy = ieReadSpectra('D65',wave);
d65XYZ    = ieXYZFromEnergy(d65Energy(:)',wave);
d65Energy = d65Energy*100/d65XYZ(2);

% Have a look at the SPD and note the energy levels
vcNewGraphWin; plot(wave,d65Energy); grid on
xlabel('Wavelength (nm)');ylabel('Watts/sr/nm/m2')

% Next, convert the light from energy units to photons.
d65Photons = Energy2Quanta(wave(:),d65Energy(:));
vcNewGraphWin; plot(wave,d65Photons); grid on
xlabel('Wavelength (nm)');ylabel('Photons/sr/nm/m2')

% The proper filters will be used when you calculate XYZ with the proper
% functions, such as:
d65XYZ = ieXYZFromPhotons(d65Photons(:)',wave)
d65XYZ = ieXYZFromEnergy(d65Energy(:)',wave)

%% CIE Luminance (Y)
% For those of you interested, the relationship between the XYZ curves and
% the luminance level (Y) is a simple relationship:

dnm = wave(2)-wave(1);   % Wavelength step
% The 683 value is a constant used by the CIE having to do with certain
% material standards.  The two formula return the same values
d65XYZ = dnm*683*XYZPhotons'*d65Photons(:)
d65XYZ = dnm*683*XYZEnergy'*d65Energy(:)
