%% Computing XYZ values of a monitor
%
% We must measure the main functions that define the color properties of
% any display: these are the phosphor spectral power distributions (SPDs).
% We measure these functions using a spectral radiometer, a device that
% measures the power per nanometer emitted by the display.
%
% The spectral power distributions of a monitor in my lab, measured when
% the monitor display intensity was set to full value, are stored in
% columns of the matrix called "phosphors". This matrix is stored in the
% data file below

% Read in a display
d = displayCreate('CRT-Dell');
phosphors  = displayGet(d,'spd');
wavelength = displayGet(d,'wave');

% Plot the display phosphors
ieNewGraphWin
plot(wavelength,phosphors(:,1),'r-', ...
    wavelength,phosphors(:,2), 'g-',...
    wavelength,phosphors(:,3),'b-')
xlabel('Wavelength (nm)'), ylabel('Intensity')
title('Spectral Power Distribution of Example CRT');
set(gca,'xlim',[350 750]), grid on

%  To measure the XYZ values of these phosphors, we load in the xbar,ybar,
%  zbar functions defined by the CIE.  These are also stored in the columns
%  of a matrix, called xyz.  Because these functions are so widely used,
%  they are stored in the main toolbox area.

ieNewGraphWin
XYZ = ieReadSpectra('XYZ',wavelength);
plot(wavelength, XYZ(:,1:3));
xlabel('Wavelength (nm)'), ylabel('Responsivity')
legend('xbar','ybar','zbar');
title('CIE XYZ Functions');
set(gca,'xlim',[350 750]), grid on

% To compute the (X,Y,Z) values of each of the phosphors by multiplying the
% phosphor matrix times the xyz matrix. Notice that the phosphors are in
% the columns of the matrix on the right, and the xbar,ybar,zbar functions
% are in the rows of the matrix on the left.

maxXYZ = XYZ'*phosphors

% This calculation doesn't take into account the proper constants and
% details of the formula.  There is a routine that manages that for you.

maxXYZ = ieXYZFromEnergy(phosphors',wavelength(:));

% The luminance of each phosphor is given by the Y values.  The
% maximum value is when the phosphors are set to maximum intensity.

maxXYZ(2,:)

% The total luminance the display can reach, with all three phosphors on,
% is given by the sum of these three values, 100 cd/m^2 is a typical
% luminance level for monitors.

sum(maxXYZ(2,:))

%% Using the CMFs to Match a target (linear display, gamma = 1)
%
%  Suppose that you send a space ship to the surface of Mars. The spaceship
%  sends back a measurement of a spectral power distribution.  Let's load
%  it up.

% We set up again, but this time we suppose the display is only calibrated
% from 400 to 700 in 5 nm steps.  
wavelength = 400:5:700;
d = displayCreate('CRT-Dell',wavelength);
phosphors  = displayGet(d,'spd');
XYZ = ieReadSpectra('XYZ',wavelength);

marsSPD = ieReadSpectra('mars.mat',wavelength);
clf,plot(wavelength,marsSPD,'r-')
set(gca,'ylim',[0 1])
grid on, xlabel('wavelength (nm)'); ylabel('Intensity')
title('Spectral Power Distribution measurement from Mars');

% Now, how do we set the monitor intensities so that what we see on a
% display is a visual match to the spectrum measured on Mars?  We use the
% XYZ color-matching functions.  First, measure the values for the Martian
% spectrum
marsXYZ = ieXYZFromEnergy(marsSPD',wavelength(:));

% Now, recall that the monitor color properties are determined by the
% relative intensity of the outputs of the monitor phosphor SPDs.  Suppose
% these intensities are [r,g,b]'.  Then the monitor output is
% phosphors*[r,g,b]'.  For example, when the red phosphor only is on the
% spectrum is

plot(wavelength, phosphors*[1 0 0]', 'r-');
xlabel('wavelength(nm)'); ylabel('Intensity')
title('Energy (Red Phosphor)');

% When the red and blue are on, the output is

plot(wavelength, phosphors*[1 0 1]','m-');
xlabel('wavelength(nm)'); ylabel('Intensity')
title('Energy of Red and Blue Phosphors combined');

% To find the relationship between the [r,g,b] values and the monitor XYZ
% outputs, we only need to multiply the output times the XYZ functions.
% Hence, there is a matrix that maps the linear monitor intensities into
% the XYZ values.  This matrix is
% 
RGB2XYZ = ieXYZFromEnergy(phosphors',wavelength)';

% Take a look at this matrix and think about its entries.  Notice that the
% first column contains the XYZ values associated with the red phosphor,
% the middle with the green, and the third column is associated with the
% blue.  These values should make sense to you given the shapes of the XYZ
% functions we have already plotted.

% Now, to represent the Martian spectrum on our display, we need to compute
% only one more thing.  How do we set the [r,g,b] values when we know the
% XYZ values of the spectrum?  For this, we need a matrix that converts XYZ
% to monitor linear gun intensities, the inverse of the matrix that we
% have.  So, we calculate this new matrix as

XYZ2RGB = inv(RGB2XYZ)
marsRGB = XYZ2RGB*marsXYZ'

% This shows that the XYZ from the two energy values are the same XYZ.
ieXYZFromEnergy((phosphors*marsRGB)',wavelength)
ieXYZFromEnergy(marsSPD',wavelength)

% The spectrum we should display, therefore, is equal to 
ieNewGraphWin;
subplot(2,1,1)
plot(wavelength,phosphors*marsRGB)
title('Output SPD of the monitor');
set(gca,'ylim',[0 2])
xlabel('wavelength(nm)');ylabel('Energy (watts/nm/sr/m^2)')

% This will be a visual match to the spectrum
subplot(2,1,2) 
plot(wavelength,marsSPD);
set(gca,'ylim',[0 2])
title('SPD of original martian image');
xlabel('wavelength(nm)');ylabel('Energy')

% The principles are the same when we make a match on a normal monitor.
% The only difference, which is reviewed below, is that the frame-buffer
% entries and the intensity of the phosphor output are a nonlinearly
% related. Hence, we must set the frame-buffer entries so that we obtain
% the linear intensity outputs we have just calculated.  This process is
% called gamma correction.

%% Managing a nonlinear display - Gamma tables and inverse gamma tables
%
% The relationship between the intensity emitted by a CRT phosphor and the
% frame-buffer value is generally a nonlinear function. An example of the
% function relating frame-buffer value to emitted light intensity is shown
% here:

load cMatch/monitorGam
ieNewGraphWin;
plot(1:256,monitorGam(:,1)), grid on
xlabel('Frame buffer'); 
ylabel('Emitted intensity of red phoshor');
title('Display "Gamma" function')

% This is called the "gamma" function of the display.  The reason for this
% title is that the function is roughly a simple power function and the
% exponent has historically been called "gamma." Here is a comparison of
% the gamma function of the red phosphor and a power function with an
% exponent of 2.2, the most common value.

frameBuffer = 1:256;
pred = ((frameBuffer)/256).^(2.2);
plot(frameBuffer,pred,'k-',frameBuffer,monitorGam(:,1),'r-')
xlim([0 256]); xlabel('Frame buffer'); ylabel('Intensity');
title('Comparison of Power function and red phosphor emission')
legend('y = x^2^.^2', 'Red phosphor','Location', 'NorthWest');
grid on

% For this display, you can see that the fit is much better using a larger
% exponent, namely

frameBuffer = 1:256;
pred = ((frameBuffer)/256).^(2.7);
plot(frameBuffer,pred,'k-',frameBuffer,monitorGam(:,1),'r-')
xlim([0 256]); xlabel('Frame buffer'); ylabel('Intensity');
title('Comparison of Power function and red phosphor emission')
legend('y = x^2^.^7', 'Red phosphor','Location', 'NorthWest');
grid on

% Recall that we measured the emitted intensity using the maximum
% framebuffer value.  This corresponds to the column entries in phosphor,
% and these are the signals emitted when the relative intensity is one.

% To specify the intensity of the emitted light for any given frame-buffer
% level, we can use the simple gamma function.  For example, the spectral
% power distribution of the light emitted by the green phosphor at a frame
% buffer level of 130 is

emitted = phosphors(:,2)*monitorGam(130,2);
plot(wavelength,emitted), grid on
xlabel('Wavelength')
ylabel('Intensity')
title('SPD of Green Phosphor at fb = 130');

% Frequently, we are interested in how to set the frame-buffer
% level in order to obtain a given linear output intensity.  To
% determine this, we must calculate the inverse of the "gamma"
% function.  If we have fit a simple polynomial to the gamma
% function, then we can calculate the frame-buffer setting by
% inverting the function.  So that given a linear intensity, l,
% we can calculate the frame-buffer value as frame-buffer =
% l^(1/gamma).

ieNewGraphWin;
intensity = 0:.001:1;
predFB = intensity.^(1/2.7);
plot(intensity,predFB)
xlabel('Intensity')
ylabel('Frame buffer level')
title('Gamma Function Inverse');
grid on

% Another way to perform this calculation is by creating a
% look-up table that inverts the gamma function.  You should take
% a look at the code in the function "mkInvGammaTable" to see how
% Xuemei Zhang and I create inverse gamma look-up table
% functions.  To see the code enter "type mkInvGammaTable"

invGamTable = mkInvGammaTable(monitorGam,1000);
plot((1:1000)/1000,invGamTable), grid on
xlabel('Relative intensity')
ylabel('Frame buffer level')
title('Inverse Gamma Table Values');

% (We make invGamTables with more than 8 bits of resolution
% because some of the frame buffers we have in the lab are 10
% bits.)

% To look up the frame buffer value that will produce a
% particular linear intensity, then, we round the intensity to 1
% part in a thousand (because there are a 1000 levels in the
% inverse table) and then use that as an index.  For example, to
% calculate the frame buffer values that generate linear
% intensities of [.1 .3 .5 .7 .9] we calculate as

intensity = (.1:.2:.9);
intensityX = round(intensity*1000)
fb = round(invGamTable(intensityX,1))

% Now, let's see how well we did.  Here are the intensities we
% will obtain with these frame buffer values.

obtainedIntensity = monitorGam(fb,1)

% We can plot the obtained and desired intensities in a graph
% We are close, but because of the quantization of the device we
% do not obtain the exact linear intensities.

plot(intensity, obtainedIntensity, 'o', intensity, intensity,'-'), grid on
axis equal, axis square, axis tight
set(gca,'xtick',(0:.2:1),'ytick',(0:.2:1))
%identityLine = line([0 1],[0 1]);
legend('Obtained Intensity', 'Ideal Intensity', 'Location', 'NorthWest');
title('Ideal vs Obtained Intensity');

%% Computing xy-chromaticity coordinates
%
% The monitor is also described in terms of several different
% chromaticity coordinate measurements, namely its "white point"
% and the gamut of colors that it can reach.  The white point is
% the chromaticity coordinates of the display when all three
% phosphors are set to maximum intensity.  These can be computed
% as

% We put the XYZ values into the columns (note the transpose)
maxXYZ = ieXYZFromEnergy(phosphors',wavelength(:))';

whitePoint = chromaticity(sum(maxXYZ,2)')'

% The (x,y) chromaticity coordinates of the phosphors can be
% computed individually as

xyMonitor = chromaticity(maxXYZ')'

% We can build a graph describing the chromaticity coordinates of
% the phosphors and the white point by first computing the xy
% coordinates of the spectrum.  Remember that the rows of xyz
% contain the XYZ values of each spectral light.  So, we can
% compute the chromaticity of the spectral lights as

xySpectrum = chromaticity(XYZ)';
% Modified 01-06-2005 PC xySpectrum = chromaticity(XYZ');

% Now, we plot these values and turn on hold.  Any light is a
% mixture of spectral lights, so these values define an outer
% boundary for where any physical light can fall.

plotSpectrumLocus;  % Read this routine
axis equal, axis square
grid on, xlabel('x-chromaticity'), ylabel('y-chromaticity')
title('Spectrum Locus (gamut of visible light)');
hold on

% Overlay the xy coordinates of the three monitor phosphors on
% top of the graph

plot(xyMonitor(1,1),xyMonitor(2,1),'ro');
plot(xyMonitor(1,2),xyMonitor(2,2),'go');
plot(xyMonitor(1,3),xyMonitor(2,3),'bo');

% and place a patch over the region where sums of the phosphors
% can fall.  This is called the "gamut" of the display

p = patch(xyMonitor(1,:), xyMonitor(2,:), [.5 .5 .5]);

% Finally, add in the chromaticity coordinate of the white point
% and label the axes.

plot(whitePoint(1),whitePoint(2),'wo');
xlabel('x chromaticity'), ylabel('y chromaticity')
hold off

% Notice that the white point coordinates are not at the middle
% of the gamut.  The position of the white point depends on the
% sum of the (X,Y,Z) values from each of the phosphors.  These
% are unequal, with the green and blue being the largest.  Hence,
% the white point is closer to these two corners of the gamut 

sum(maxXYZ)

%% ISET makes it easy to plot the gamut, by the way

% These ideas are all embedded in the existing plotting routines. But the
% point of this script is to show you the ideas, not to plot the gamut.

%% TUTORIAL QUESTIONS
%
% USING THE COLOR MATCHING FUNCTIONS
%
% Consider a color matching experiment using a CRT monitor with phosphor
% spectral power distributions (SPD) given by 'phosphors' in 
% cMatch/monitor.mat
%
% a) Using the CIE-XYZ method, calculate what phosphor intensities you will
% need to match a monochrome light at 550nm.  What phosphor intensities are
% needed to match a monochrome light at 430nm?
%
% b) Plot the SPD of the phosphors that would make this match.  Why are
% these intensities not physically realizable?
%
% c) If you wanted to perform an experiment to test the predicted match,
% what could you do to arrange the viewing conditions?
%
%
% COLOR MONITOR CALIBRATION AND CHROMATICITY
%
% a) Let the SPDs of the three phosphors of a color monitor be R, G, and B.
% Let the value of a pixel be written as a vector x = [r,g,b], where r, g, 
% and b are between 0 and 1. 
%
% Write the matrix equation that expresses the SPD of a monitor pixel
% displaying the pixel x.  (Ignore gamma correction)
%
% 
% b) How do the set of spectral power distributions emitted from a pixel
% compare with the spectral power distributions that are possible in the
% environment?
%
% c) Typical monitors can modulate the linear phosphor intensity at 256
% levels (8-bits). Suppose that you could modulate the phosphor intensities
% at 16-bit accuracy. Would this monitor produce better images?  If you are
% not sure, then state what you need to know about the human visual system
% to decide whether the improvement is worthwhile.
%
% d) Suppose that you are able to build a monitor with a fourth phosphor,
% not just the three that are usually built. In what sense would this
% monitor be better than a three-primary monitor?  If you could set the x-y
% chromaticity of the phosphor, how would you design it to achieve the best
% monitor performance?  You may want to sketch or plot a chromaticity
% diagram to show what you mean.
%
%% Optional questions
% 
% Suppose you are an LCD manufacturer, and you know that if you had an
% ideal LCD, each of the R,G,B color channels would emit light 
% according to the SPD given in monitors.mat.  We have already plotted
% the color gamut of such a monitor.
%
% In a real LCD display, the LC gates are not able to block 100% of the
% light from the backlight.  Suppose that due to such leakage, the 
% contrast ratio between a fully black and fully white display is 100:1.  
% Plot the gamut of colors for this display and explain what happens.
