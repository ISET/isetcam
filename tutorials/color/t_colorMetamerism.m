%% Illustrate a metameric matching and chromatic aberration
%
% Metamerism is a fundamental insight of color science.  In its principal
% scientific use, metamers are lights with different spectral power
% distributions that are visually indistinguishable.
%
% People in industry also use metamerism to refer to the phenomenon that
% the same surface, scene under two different lights, does not appear the
% same.
%
% This script describes the scientific analysis of metamers.  We simulate a
% uniform field with D65 spectral power distribution and find a matching
% (metameric) LCD display output.
%
% The two metameric lights are then used to create a bar pattern. We
% represent the bar pattern after optical blurring and then encoded by the
% human cone sensor array.

% am thinking of changing because, well, computers are now faster.
