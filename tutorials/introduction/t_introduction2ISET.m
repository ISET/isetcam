%% Initialize ISET variables and structures
%
% The ieInit function closes windows and can clear your variables,
% depending on how you set your ISET preferences.

% Here is how your preferences are set
getpref('ISET')   % Current status

% To clear workspace variables on ieInit, do this
setpref('ISET','initclear',true);    

% To preserve workspace variables on ieInit, do this
setpref('ISET','initclear',false);   

ieInit;

%% Scene spectral radiance
% There are several ways to create a scene. One is to use the *sceneCreate* 
% function. In the example below, we create a scene of the Macbeth Color Checker 
% illuminated with a tungsten light For a complete list of the types of synthetic 
% scenes type *doc sceneCreate*.
% 
% A second method for creating a scene is to read data from a file. ISET 
% includes a few multispectral scenes as part of the distribution. These can be 
% found in the data/image/multispectral directory You can also select the file 
% (or many other files) using the command:
% 
%     * fullFileName = vcSelectImage;*
% 
% See also: s_sceneFromMultispectral.m, s_sceneFromRGB.m and  scripts/scenes 
%%
wave = 400:10:700;
patchSize = 64;
scene = sceneCreate('macbeth tungsten',patchSize,wave);

% It is often useful to visualize the data in the scene window
sceneWindow(scene);

%% The scene illuminant
% Within the ISET framework, we use specific functions to interact with the 
% objects.  All of the major types of objects have a Create, Get, Set and Plot 
% function.  For example, to plot the illuminant of a scene, you can use scenePlot();
%%
scenePlot(scene,'illuminant energy roi');
%% It is possible to change the scene illuminant
% There are also many different utilities that do useful things.  For example 
% to change the illuminant spectral power distribution use this code.
%%
scene = sceneAdjustIlluminant(scene,'D65.mat');
scene = sceneSet(scene,'name','D65'); % Set the scene name
scenePlot(scene,'illuminant energy roi');

%% 
% You can adjust  properties using the sceneSet command.  Here we adjust 
% the scene mean luminance and field of view.

scene = sceneAdjustLuminance(scene,200);  % Candelas/m2
scene = sceneSet(scene,'fov',26.5);       % Set the scene horizontal field of view
scene = sceneInterpolateW(scene,wave,true); % Resample, preserve luminance
sceneWindow(scene);            % if you want to view the change in the GUI window
%% Optics
% There are also simple functions to transform between the objects, say from 
% the scene (radiance) to the optical image (irradiance). To explore the effect 
% of optics let's use a scene with lots of radial lines.  This is one of the many 
% 'baked' test images.  You can see all of them and how to adjust their parameters 
% by typing *doc sceneCreate.*
%%
scene = sceneCreate('radial lines');
sceneWindow(scene);
%% Calculate the optical image (irradiance at the sensor)
% The optical image is an important structure, like the scene structure. We 
% adjust the properties of optical image formation using the oiSet and oiGet routines.
% 
% ISET has several optics models that you can experiment with. These include 
% shift-invariant optics, in which there is a different shift-invariant pointspread 
% function for each wavelength, and a ray-trace method, in which we read in data 
% from Zemax and create a shift-variant set of pointspread functions along with 
% a geometric distortion function.
%%
oi = oiCreate;

% The simplest is method of creating an optical image is to use
% the diffraction-limited lens model.  To create diffraction
% limited optics with an f# of 12, which will blur the image substantially, 
% you can call these functions 
oi = oiSet(oi,'optics fnumber',2.8);

% In this example we set the properties of the optics to include
% cos4th falloff for the off axis vignetting of the imaging lens,
% and we set the lens focal length to 3 mm.
oi = oiSet(oi,'optics offaxis method','cos4th');
oi = oiSet(oi,'optics focal length',3e-3);
oi = oiCompute(oi,scene);

% Save the optical image structure and bring up the optical image
% window.
oiWindow(oi);

%% 
% Many other optics and oi properties can be set . For a list see *doc opticsSet, 
% and doc oiSet.*
% 
% We use the scene structure and the optical image structure to update the 
% irradiance. From the window you can see a wide range of options. These include 
% insertion of a birefringent anti-aliasing filter, turning off cos4th image fall-off, 
% adjusting the lens properties, and so forth.
% 
% You can read more about optics models properties by typing  *doc opticsGet*. 
%% Sensor

% The irradiance is then captured by a simulated sensor,
% resulting in an array of output voltages. There are a very
% large number of sensor parameters. Here we illustrate the
% process of creating a simple Bayer-gbrg sensor and setting a
% few of its basic properties.
%
% To create the sensor structure, we call
sensor = sensorCreate('bayer (rggb)');

% We set the sensor properties using *sensorSet* and *sensorGet*
% routines.
%
% Just as the optical irradiance gives a special status to the
% optics, the sensor gives a special status to the pixel.  In
% this section we define the key pixel and sensor properties, and
% we then put the sensor and pixel back together.

% To get the pixel structure from the sensor we use:
pixel =  sensorGet(sensor,'pixel');

% Here are some of the key pixel properties
voltageSwing   = 1.15;  % Volts
wellCapacity   = 9000;  % Electrons
conversiongain = voltageSwing/wellCapacity;   
fillfactor     = 0.45;       % A fraction of the pixel area
pixelSize      = 2.2*1e-6;   % Meters
darkvoltage    = 1e-005;     % Volts/sec
readnoise      = 0.00096;    % Volts

% We set the pixel properties here.  
sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'pixel size same fill factor',[pixelSize pixelSize]);   
sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'pixel conversion gain', conversiongain);        
sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'pixel voltage swing',voltageSwing);                                             
sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'pixel dark voltage',darkvoltage) ;               
sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'pixel read noise volts',readnoise);  

%  Now we set some general sensor properties
dsnu =  0.0010;           % Volts (dark signal non-uniformity)
prnu = 0.2218;            % Percent (ranging between 0 and 100) photodetector response non-uniformity
analogGain   = 1;         % Used to adjust ISO speed
analogOffset = 0;         % Used to account for sensor black level
rows = 466;               % number of pixels in a row
cols = 642;               % number of pixels in a column

% Set sensor properties
sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'auto exposure',true);
% N.B. You could set the exposure duration explicitly using
% sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'exp time',0.030);

% Some other 
sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'rows',rows);
sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'cols',cols);
sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'dsnu level',dsnu);  
sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'prnu level',prnu); 
sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'analog Gain',analogGain);     
sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'analog Offset',analogOffset);   

% Adjust the pixel fill factor
sensor = pixelCenterFillPD(sensor,fillfactor);

% It is also possible to replace the spectral quantum efficiency curves of
% the sensor with those from a calibrated camera.  We include the
% calibration data from a very nice Nikon D100 camera as part of ISET.
% To load those data we first determine the wavelength samples for this sensor.
wave = sensorGet(sensor,'wave');

% Then we load the calibration data and attach them to the sensor structure
fullFileName = fullfile(isetRootPath,'data','sensor','colorfilters','nikon','NikonD100.mat');
[data,filterNames] = ieReadColorFilter(wave,fullFileName); 
sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'filter spectra',data);
sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'filter names',filterNames);
sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'Name','Camera-Simulation');

% We are now ready to compute the sensor image
sensor = sensorCompute(sensor,oi);

% We can view sensor image in the GUI.  Note that the image that
% comes up shows the color of each pixel in the sensor mosaic.
% Also, please be aware that the Matlab rendering algorithm often
% introduces unwanted artifacts into the display window.  You can
% resize the window to eliminate these. You can also set the
% display gamma function to brighten the appearance in the edit
% box at the lower left of the window.
sensorWindow(sensor);

% There are a variety of ways to quantify these data in the
% pulldown menus. Also, you can view the individual pixel data
% either by zooming on the image (Edit | Zoom) or by bringing the
% image viewer tool (Edit | Viewer).
%
% See also: *iexL2ColorFilter*
%
% ISET includes a wide array of options for selecting color
% filters, fill-factors, infrared blocking filters, adjusting
% pixel properties, color filter array patterns, and exposure
% modes.
%% Image Processor
%%
% The sensor array is demosaiced, color-balanced, and rendered on
% a display The image processing pipeline is managed by the
% fourth principal ISET structure, the virtual camera image (ip).
% This structure allows the user to set a variety of image
% processing methods, including demosaicking and color balancing.
ip = ipCreate;

% The routines for setting and getting image processing
% parameters are ipGet and ipSet.
%
ip = ipSet(ip,'name','Unbalanced');
ip = ipSet(ip,'scale display',1);

% The default properties use bilinear demosaicking, no color
% conversion or balancing.  The sensor RGB values are simply set
% to the display RGB values.
ip = ipCompute(ip,sensor);

% As in the other cases, we can bring up a window to view the
% processed data, this time a full RGB image.
ieAddObject(ip); ipWindow

%% You can experiment by changing the processing parameters 

% For example
ip2 = ipSet(ip,'name','More Balanced');
ip2 = ipSet(ip2,'internalCS','XYZ');
ip2 = ipSet(ip2,'conversion method sensor','MCC Optimized');
ip2 = ipSet(ip2,'correction method illuminant','Gray World');

% With these parameters, the colors will appear to be more accurate
ip2 = ipCompute(ip2,sensor);

ipWindow(ip2)

% Again, this window offers the opportunity to perform many
% parameter changes and to evaluate certain metric properties of
% the current system. Try the pulldown menu item (Analyze |
% Create Slanted Bar) and then run the pulldown menu (Analyze |
% ISO12233) to obtain a spatial frequency response function for
% the slanted bar image in the ISO standard.
%% How to reduce the chromatic aliasing
%%
% Increase the optical blur
oi = oiSet(oi,'optics fnumber',8);
oi = oiCompute(oi,scene);
sensor = sensorCompute(sensor,oi);
ip = ipCompute(ip,sensor);
ipWindow(ip);
