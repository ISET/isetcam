function photons = Energy2Quanta(wavelength,energy)
% Convert energy (watts) to number of photons.
%
%   photons = Energy2Quanta(wavelength,energy)
%
% Energy (e.g., watts) is returned in units of photons, that is from
% watts/sr/m2/nm to photons/sr/m2/nm.  The parameter wavelength is the
% vector of sample wavelengths in units of nanometers (nm).
%
% The return (photons) is in the same format.
%
% FORMAT:
% The columns of the matrix energy are different spatial samples. The
% entries down a column represent the energy as a function of wavelength.
% Thus, the entries across a row represent the energy at a single
% wavelength for each of the samples. This format is unfortunate, because
% it is the transpose of the standard XW format used throughout the rest of
% ISET. It is also the transpose of the format used in Quanta2Energy.
%
% In the fullness of time, this function will be converted to XW format;
% but it will require some effort because they are inserted in so many
% important places.  I am going to need a long holiday to make this change.

% Examples:
%   wave = 400:10:700;
%   in = [blackbody(wave,5000,'energy'),blackbody(wave,6000,'energy')];
%   p = Energy2Quanta(wave,in);
%   figure; plot(wave,p);
%
% Notice that in the return, out becomes a row vector, consistent with XW
% format. Also, notice that we have to transpose p to make this work.
% Tragic.
%
%   out = Quanta2Energy(wave,p');      % out is a row vector, XW format
%   figure; plot(wave,in,'ro',wave,out','k-')
