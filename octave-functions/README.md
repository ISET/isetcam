### MATLAB Functions for Octave

- This directory hosts custom implementations of MATLAB functions that are otherwise unavailable in Octave. 
- New: Included an `isOctave` test to keep the code both Matlab and Octave compatible. 
Note: Some of these functions are written with the help of AI tools and have been tested on ISET examples.
