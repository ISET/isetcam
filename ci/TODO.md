# computational imaging classes todo list.
# D.Cardinal current as of Jan 4, 2021

NEAR TERM:
* support pbrt lens files by correctly processing oi returns
* [short term fix is reRender flag] 
    figure out a rational rendered scene caching strategy
* maybe do something useful with Portrait & Scenic intents, etc.
* look at Brian's suggestion of focus stacking

LONGER TERM:
* more complex processing framework to start using ai or whatever
* add support for multiple camera modules
