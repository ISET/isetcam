# computational imaging classes todo list:

NEAR TERM:
* support pbrt lens files by correctly processing oi returns
* figure out a rational rendered scene caching strategy
* add support for non-pbrt input scenes
* figure out how to emulate dark/"night" scenes, etc.
* maybe do something useful with Portrait & Scenic intents, etc.

LONGER TERM:
* more complex processing framework to start using ai or whatever
* add support for multiple camera modules
