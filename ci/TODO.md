# computational imaging classes todo list.
# D.Cardinal current as of Jan 4, 2021

NEAR TERM:
* support pbrt lens files by correctly processing oi returns -- right now we don't have the right FOV
* maybe do something useful with Portrait & Scenic intents, etc.
* Fix focus stacking. "Runs" but we aren't getting variable focus

MEDIUM TERM:
* Codify architecture so students have a platform on which they know how to build.

LONGER TERM:
* more complex processing framework to start using ai or whatever
* add support for multiple camera modules
