%
% ImagEval comments --
%
%   The CIE delta E standard is a fundamental tool of color science.  The
%   metric is described in a wide variety of textbooks.  It has gone
%   through a series of refinements over the years.  This code is the
%   CIEDE2000.
%
%   K is a 3 vector, in the form [kL, kC, kH]. k =[1 1 1] for the basic
%   conditions (uniform surround field with L*=50, 1000lx illuminance
%   homogeneous stimulus >4 degree visual angle, color difference between
%   0-5 CIELAB units). In the textile industry kL is commonly set to 2.
%   Default k is [1 1 1];
%
%   The Labstd and Labsample matrices contain corresponding pairs of CIELAB
%   values.  The difference between these is the error measure.  The CIELAB
%   values are computed from CIE XYZ measurements using standard lab
%   equipment.
%
%   ImagEval added a new return term (errComponents) that contains the
%   separate luminance, chromatic, and hue error terms.  These components,
%   which are scaled and combined
%
%   The original authors and a reference source for this code are cited
%   below. The comments in the original source code follow:
%
% Original comments --
%
% Compute the CIEDE2000 color-difference between the sample between a
% reference with CIELab coordinates Labsample and a standard with CIELab
% coordinates Labstd
%
% The function works on multiple standard and sample vectors too provided
% Labstd and Labsample are K x 3 matrices with samples and standard
% specification in corresponding rows of Labstd and Labsample The optional
% argument KLCH is a 1x3 vector containing the the value of the parametric
% weighting factors kL, kC, and kH these default to 1 if KLCH is not
% specified.
