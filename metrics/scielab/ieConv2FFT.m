%Obsolete: Compute 2d-convolution by FFT => IFFT on 2D data
%
%   z = ieConv2FFT(A, B, method)
%
%  A, B are the input 2D matrices. Method can be either 'same' or none [].
%
% Should probably not be called.  This routine pads both A and B with zeros
% to sum of their sizes and then applies the fft2 to them both.  The
% zero-padding is kind of special and can screw a lot of stuff up.

% The arrays are padded with zeros to become the same size. It's not just
% that the smaller one is padded up to the bigger one.  They are both
% padded with zeros, no matter what, to the sum of the two sizes.  This is
% not good.
