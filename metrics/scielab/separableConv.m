function result = separableConv(im, xkernels, ykernels)
%
% Two-dimensional convolution with X-Y separable kernels.
%
% im is the input matric. im is reflected on all sides before
%   convolution.
% xkernels and ykernels are both row vectors. If ykernels is not
%   given, then use xkernels as ykernels.
% If xkernels and ykernels are matrices, each row is taken as
%   one convolution kernel and convolved with the image, and the
%   sum of the results is returned.
%
% This function is useful when a 2-D filter can be represented by
% a linear combination of several separable filters. If the number
% of separable filters that form the 2-D filter is not too large
% this can be substantially faster than conv2.
