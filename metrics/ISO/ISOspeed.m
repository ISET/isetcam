function speed = ISOspeed(speedType,ISA)
%Compute ISO saturation speed and in the future other speeds
%
%   speed = ISOspeed(speedType,[ISA])
%
% Estimate a sensor's ISO speed according to either the saturation or noise
% method.
%
% The saturation ISO speed summarizes "how much light" is needed to make
% the "bright parts" in the image saturate. The higher the ISO speed the
% less light is needed to achieve just that. Saturation-based ISO speed
% measures  sensitivity: the higher the ISO speed the more "sensitive"  the
% system.
%
% The saturation ISO speed is a property of the Sensor; it does not depend
% on other camera properies such as optics and processing.  (Well, actually
% depends on the type of light illuminating the scene, but more on that
% later)
%
% The properties that govern the Saturation ISO speed are: a) The well
% capacity: Nmax (units: electrons) b) The Responsivity functions of the
% Sensor (i.e. QE): R (units: electrons/photos)
%
% Now the formula. To get there we must clarify some things:  1) How are
% "bright parts" defined? The brightest parts are higlights. According to
% ISO highlights are sqrt(2), i.e. 41% brighter than a white (100%)
% reflector.
%
% 2) How is "amount of light" defined?, According to ISO there are two
% Saturation based ISO speeds defined, one for D65 and one for Tungsten
% for the remainder let's stick with D65. a) The technical term for "amount
% of light" is the photometric quantity "Exposure" measured in lux*s and
% abreviated with the letter H. b) There is also a more specific definition
% of "Camera Exposure" which is the amount of light that reaches the sensor
% from a 0.14 gray reflector, if(!) the image is correctly exposed.
%
% Hence the question now becomes:
% a) How much D65 light (measured in lux*s) is needed to make the sensor
% saturate.
%
% Solve for scalefactor:
%    Nmax = Max[R'*SceneLightSpectrum/H(SceneLightSpectrum)*scaleFactor]
% Calculate Highlight Exposure:
%    H_highlight = H(SceneLightSpectrum)*scaleFactor
%
% b) How high was the "Camera Exposure" for that case.
%     H_camera = (H_highlight/sqrt(2))*.14
%
% Finally, ISO saturation speed
%   SaturationISOspeed = 10/H_camera
