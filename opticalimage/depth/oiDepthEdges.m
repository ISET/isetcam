%    f = opticsGet(optics,'focal length','m');
%    optics = opticsSet(optics,'focal length',5*f);
%

% image plane is at the focal length infinite distance is in focus and
% everything closer has negative defocus in diopters.

%
% depthEdges: depths that achieve the relative defocus spacing when image
%    is in the focal plane.
% imageDist: image distance the optics to achieve a best focus at inFocusDepth
% oDefocus: the defocus at these depthEdges when the image plane is
%    imageDist.
