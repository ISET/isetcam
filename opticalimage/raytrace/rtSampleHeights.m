function [imgHeight, maxDataHeight] = rtSampleHeights(allHeights, dataHeight)
% Find image height values from ray trace that are within the oi field height
%
%   [imgHeight,maxDataHeight] = rtSampleHeights(allHeights,dataHeight)
%
% The list of ray trace image heights needed for the data are returned in
% imgHeight. The highest value of the data is in maxDataHeight. The units
% returned are the same as those sent in.  Typically, these are in
% millimeters.

% Examples:
%  Suppose we only want to compute half the image:
%
%    allHeights = opticsGet(optics,'rtPSFfieldHeight','mm');
%    dataHeight = oiGet(oi,'height','mm')
%    [imgHeight,maxDataHeight] = rtSampleHeights(allHeights,dataHeight/2)
