% data are the optical image irradiance blurred by the PSF of the optics.
% The rBlock and cBlock define which block we are managing.  The
% blockSamples defines the number of spatial samples (row,col) in each
% block.  The blockPadding defines how much we pad the blocks when we
% filter the data.  Usually we pad each dimension by the amount of
% blockSamples.
