%Precompute shift-variant PSFs for ray trace model
%
%    svPSF = rtPrecomputePSF([oi],[angStepSize],[cPosition = (0,0)])
%
% The svPSF is a structure that contains the PSFs from the ray trace
% portion of the optical image, oi. The shift-variant psf (svPSF) structure
% is derived from the ray trace information stored in the optics slot.
% This structure is calculated for a specific computation, and then the
% structure is stored in the oi.psf slot, not inside the optics.
%
% The svPSF contains the point spreads functions (psf) for all the image
% height, wavelength, and angles in the optical image.
%
% The psf dimensionality is [nAngles, M radial heights, and W wavelengths].
% The M radial heights are at the heights of the original PSF estimates.
%
% Angles are measured every angStepSize (degrees).  The default is 1 deg.
% The angles represented are [0:angStepSize:360], to include both 0 and
% 360, because that helps subsequent interpolation (see rtAngleLUT).
%
% The source code contains examples.
