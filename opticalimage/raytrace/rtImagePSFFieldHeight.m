function rtImagePSFFieldHeight
% Not functional yet - or perhaps implemented elsewhere.
%
% 1.  Plot PSFs as a function of field height
% 
% foo = [];
% for ii=1:12
%     foo = [foo, rt.psf.function(:,:,ii,10)];
% end
% 
% imshow(foo)
% 
% 
% 2.  Show the interpolated distortion image (not with wavelength) but with 2D pixDistUnit
% kind of surf plot.
% 
% 
% 3.  Get rid of the darn black line.
