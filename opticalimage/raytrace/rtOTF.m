function Iout = rtOTF(scene,oi)
%Optical transfer function computation using ray tracing data
%
%    Iout = rtOTF(scene,oi)
%
% The spatially varying lens PSF is applied to an irradiance image.  Prior
% to arriving at this point the optical image irradiance data have been
% distorted and relative illumination has been applied.
%
% The PSFs applied in this routine are determined at each field location
% (height and angle) and for each wavelength.  The distortion data are used
% to determine where we are located in the field.  We use this position to
% interpolate the PSF.
%
% The algorithm is
%
%   (a) Extract the irradiance image at a single wavelength
%   (b) Extract data from a block
%        (number of blocks per field height sample can be set)
%   (c) Pad the block data
%   (d) Retrieve the relevant optics PSF and interpolate it to match the block data
%   (e) Convolve the data with PSF
%   (f) Add the result into an intermediate computational image

% Algorithm notes
%
% We should re-write this algorithm.
%
% The next iteration should
%
%  (a) Skip the rtGeometry phase for Zemax because we think the geometry may be
%  already in the point spread function. To check, using Dmitry's data.
%
%  (b) Do the point spread calculation for each point in the image but
%  using interpolated PSF measurements.  The way to approach this might be:
%     - Calculate a PSF for the corners of each block
%     - For each block
%        -- upsample the block to the PSF resolution
%        -- find the distance from each point to each PSF
%        -- output the distance-weighted sum of the PSF convolutions
%        -- downsample the result to the irradiance resolution
%
%  This uses a small number of PSFs to calculate a point-by-point
%  shift-variant output.

% Programming notes
%
% The irradiance image has dimension row,col
% The padded irradiance image accomodates the block size evenly.
%   It has dimension rowP = scenePadding + row, and colP
% The output image is further increased to allow for the block padding during convolution
%   It has dimension rowO = rowP + blockPadding = row + scenePadding + blockPadding
%   and similarly colO.
%
% The block data we filter have dimensions blockSamples
% The padded irradiance block data have dimensions
%   rowF = blockSamples + 2*blockPading
%
% Never let the data block size (in microns) limit the extent of the PSF.
% Always choose a rowF,colF value that allows the entire PSF to be
% captured.
