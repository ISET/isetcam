%
%  The scene spectral radiance (photons/s/m2/sr/nm) is turned into optical
%  image irradiance (photons/s/m2/nm) based on information in the optics.
%  The formula for converting radiance to irradiance is
%
%     irradiance = pi /(1 + 4*fN^2*(1+abs(m))^2)*radiance;
%
%  where m is the magnification and fN is the f-number of the lens.
%  Frequently, in online references one sees the simpler formula, which is
%  appropriate for almost all on-axis cases.
%
%     irradiance = pi /(4*fN^2*(1+abs(m))^2)*radiance;
%
% (e.g., Gerald C. Holst, CCD Arrays, Cameras and Displays, 2nd Edition,
% pp. 33-34 (1998))
%
%  This second formula is accurate for small angles, say when the sensor
%  sees only the paraxial rays.  The formula used here is more general and
%  includes the non-paraxial rays.
%
%  One also finds even simpler formulae, such as (https://www.opticsthewebsite.com/Radiometry)
%
%     irradiance = pi/(4*FN^2) * radiance
%
% because the magnification is usually a very small number (the world is
% big, the film or retinal image is very small) so that (1 + m)^2 is really
% very close to 1.
%
%  Reference:
%    The general formula is derived in Peter Catrysse's dissertation (pp. 150-151).
