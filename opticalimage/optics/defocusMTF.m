%
% Discussion.
%  The defocus in diopters for different thin lens to sensor distances is
%  computed in opticsDepthDefocus. The defocus for human chromatic
%  aberration is computed in the humanCore code.
%
%  The depth and defocus relation involves using the lensmaker's
%  equation. The degree of defocus depends on the aperture size. See around
%  pages 123-4 in Joe Goodman's book for the case of a square aperture, and
%  there is a formula in the humanCore code for a circular aperture.  This
%  might also be in the Marimont paper on human chromatic aberration.
%
% Example:
%  See the script s_opticsDepthDefocus.
%
% -- Old notes ---
%  We specify all frequencies in cycles per degree. We will convert for
%  people from linepairs/mm to cycles per degree. We specify the MTF for an
%  object at infinity, assuming the image plane is at the focal distance.
%  Obviously, if there is defocus (the object is not at infinity), then
%  this MTF needs to be recalculated.
%
%  We will put in a hook so that if we decide to have a different object
%  distance (and thus a different image distance), we can recalculate.
%
%   We expect this routine to be very quick so we can quickly get the 2D
%   MTF of the lens and multiply it with the spectrum of the image (freq by
%   freq).  We may end up using some indexing/rounding and table-lookup to
%   make this go faster.
