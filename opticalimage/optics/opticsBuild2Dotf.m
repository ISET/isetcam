% frequencies.  It is also used in the dist calculation.
%
% N.B.  This spatial frequency gets too high sometimes and can slow down
% the calculation.  The maxF may be, say 1000 cyc/mm in which case we would
% need 2 samples / micron to measure at that level.  Pixels are only about
% 2 microns, maybe 1 micron.  Not sure what to do here.  Could just leave
% it or we could think more.
