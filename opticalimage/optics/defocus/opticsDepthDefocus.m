%   [D, imgDist] = opticsDepthDefocus(objDist,optics,[imgPlaneDist])
%
% Inputs:
%   objDist:  Vector of object distances (meters)
%   optics:   Optics structure
%   imgPlaneDist:  Image plane distance (meters).  Default is focal length

% Outputs:
%   D:  Defocus in diopters
%   imgDist:  The image distance at which the obj at objDist is in focus
%
% The lensmaker's equation specifies the relationship between object and
% image plane distances given the focal length of a thin lens. The
% lensmaker's equation for a thin lens is
%
%    1/objDist + 1/imgDist = 1/focalLength
%
% See the thin lens equation description from Wikipedia.
% http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)
%
% The equation can be used for various purposes, including specifying the
% defocus of an object in various imaging conditions.
%
% For example,
%   * Objects at infinity are imaged in the focal plane.
%   * If the image plane is at the focal length, then closer objects will
%   be in defocus and we can assess the degree of defocus.  These will all
%   be positive.
%   * If the image plane distance differs from the focal length, we can
%   compute the defocus as a function of object distance. Object distances
%   closer and further than the in-focus distance will have negative and
%   positive defocus.
%
% There are additional lensmaker's formulae for general lenses with
% specified curvature and index of refraction measurements.  There are also
% depth of field formulae in Wikipedia and elsewhere.
%
% Examples:
%    optics = opticsCreate; fLength = opticsGet(optics,'focal length','m');
%    nSteps = 500; objDist = linspace(fLength*1.5,50*fLength,nSteps);
%    D0 = opticsGet(optics,'power');

% Simple alegebraic observations about the lensmaker's equation
%
%  It is convenient to express the object distance as a multiple of focal
%  lengths, objDist = N*fLength.  In that case
%
%   1/imgDist = 1/fLength - 1/(N*fLength)
%   1/imgDist = (1/fLength) (1 - 1/N)
%   imgDist   = fLength/(1 - (1/N))
%   imgDist   = fLength / ((N - 1)/N)
%   imgDist   = fLength * (N/(N-1))
%
% This expresses how the imgDist approaches the focal length as N gets
% large. The difference between the image plane and the focal plane is
%
%   errDist = fLength - fLength * (N/(N-1))
%   errDist = fLength * (1 - (N/(N-1))
%
% The blurring caused by this difference in best image plane depends on the
% pupil aperture as well as the focal length.  For small pupil apertures,
% there is less of a penalty in defocus (e.g., a pinhole).  The
% significance of the pupil aperture is captured in other (see, e.g.
% humanCore and opticsReducedSFandW20).

% Lensmaker's equation for a thin lens can be written:
