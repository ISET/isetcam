%Interpolate optics OTF for shift-invariant calculation in optical image
%
%  [OTF2D,fSupport] = customOTF(oi,[fSupport],[wavelength = :],[units='mm'])
%
% In the shift-invariant optics model, custom data are stored in the
% optics.OTF slot.  This routine reads the otf data and interpolates them
% to the fSupport and wavelength of the optical image or optics structure.
%
% The returned OTF is normalized so that all energy is transmitted (i.e.,
% the DC value is 1).  This is done by normalizing the peak value to one.
% If we ever have a case when the peak is other than the DC, we have a
% problem with energy conservation - where did the photons go?
%
% The units for the frequency support are cycles/millimeters.
% Perhaps we should add a 'units' input argument here.

% This is the representation of the OTF
% The units should be specified and optional; we are using mm for

% and Y.  This produces NaNs in the interpolated OTF2D, below.  We could

%   max(abs(fy(:))), max(abs(Y(:)))
% I would like to replace the opticsGet here with an oiGet call with
% frequencySupport.  There are some inconsistencies that I don't understand
% and we have to clarify.

    % The OTF2D representation is on a frequency representation where DC is
    % in (1,1), so we would want the fSupport to run from 1:N.
    % The fSupport that comes here, however, has the OTF2D from -N:N.
    % To make things match up, we apply an fftshift to the OTF2D data prior to
    % interpolating.

    % We have an error in the interpolation in some cases.
    % The interpolated OTF2D does not have a unit DC term because there is
    % a shift in position.  This happens rarely, but it happened in the
    % case of the filtered font.  We are tracking this down.  Odd and even
    % scene size is an issue.
