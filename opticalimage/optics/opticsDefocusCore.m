%
% Inputs
%  optics:    Optics structure
%  sampleSF:  Spatial frequencies in cycles/deg
%  D:         Defocus in diopters for each wavelength
%
%Returns
% otf:  Optical transfer function (actually, this is the MTF, just a set of
%       scale factors.  We assume there is no frequency-dependent phase
%       shift.
% sampleSFmm:  Sample spatial frequency in cyc/millimeters

% Converts the defocus in diopters to the Hopkins w20 parameter for a given
% pupil radius in meters, defocus (D, diopters), and dioptric power (D0).
% The explanation for this formula is in Marimont and Wandell, Appendix C:
% Converting from w20 to Defocus in diopters
w20 = (p^2/2)*(D0.*D)./(D0+D);
% plot(wave,w20);

% Re-write so we can get sampleSF in cycles/mm directly without these two
% steps.
c = opticsGet(optics,'deg per dist','m');

% The units are:
% cycles/meter = (cycles/deg) * (deg/meter)
cSF = sampleSF * c;

% The formulae in the opticsDefocusedMTF appears to have a problem handling
% the SF=0 value. At SF=0 it uses the classic diffraction formula and at
% other values it uses the formula from Marimont and Wandell.  That formula
% seems to be off by a small scale factor that we don't understand.
% By doing this, we get a smooth OTF that doesn't have a value of 1 at DC.
%
% In the code we force a DC value of 1 - but that is a hack.  We should
% figure out what's up with the formula.  Also remember that the paper by
% Subbaro claims that the scale factor on the formula is wrong.  So there's
% two of us out there.
%
% If we have SF=0, we replace it with a very small number.
