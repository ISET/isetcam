%Pad the OI to make the rows and cols even numbers

% There are interpolation problems at the OTF calculation when the row/col
% size of scene is odd. The OTF calculation is not putting the DC term in
% the right place.
%
% For now, until I understand the general way to handle the odd row and col
% values, we pad the oi to have an even number of rows and columns at the
% start of oiCompute.
%
% This is not a terrible hack because there is oi padding in any event.
