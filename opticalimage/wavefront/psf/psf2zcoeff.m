function err = psf2zcoeff(zcoeffs,psfTarget,pupilSizeMM,zpupilDiameterMM,...
    pupilPlaneSizeMM, thisWaveUM, nPixels)
% Error function for estimating Zernike Coeffs from a psf
%
% Syntax
%   This function is called as part of an fminsearch procedure.  See the
%   script s_opticsPSF2Zcoeffs for the main example
%
%  f = @(x) psf2zcoeff(x,psfTarget,pupilSizeMM,pupilPlaneSizeMM,thisWaveUM, nPixels);
%
% Description
%  Given a spread function (psfTarget), we would like to estimate the
%  Zernike coefficients.  This allows us to calculate the pupil function
%  and wavefront aberrations. This function computes the RMS error between
%  the psfTarget for a set of Zernike coefficients.  We use this function
%  as part of an fminsearch to do the estimation in s_opticsPSF2Zcoeffs
%
% Inputs:
%   zcoeffs - The Zernike coefficients.  There should be at least 5!
%        zcoeffs = wvfGet(wvf,'zcoeffs');
%   thisWaveNM -       wvfGet(wvf,'wave');
%   pupilPlaneSizeMM - wvfGet(wvf,'pupil plane size','mm',thisWaveNM);
%   thisWaveUM       - waveNM(ii)/1000;
%   nPixels          - nPixels = wvfGet(wvf,'spatial samples');
%   pupilSizeMM      - pupilSizeMM = wvfGet(wvf,'pupil size','mm');

pupilPos = (1:nPixels) - (floor(nPixels / 2) + 1);
pupilPos = pupilPos * (pupilPlaneSizeMM / nPixels);

% Do the meshgrid thing and flip y. Empirically the flip makes
% things work out right.
[xpos, ypos] = meshgrid(pupilPos);
ypos = -ypos;

% The Zernike polynomials are defined over the unit disk.  At
% measurement time, the pupil was mapped onto the unit disk, so we
% do the same normalization here to obtain the expansion over the
% disk.
%
% And by convention expanding gives us the wavefront aberrations in
% microns.
norm_radius = (sqrt(xpos.^2+ypos.^2))/(zpupilDiameterMM/2);
theta = atan2(ypos,xpos);
norm_radius_index = norm_radius <= 1;

% We keep the first entry 0 ('piston') because it has no impact on the PSF,
% according to a note in t_wvfZernike. Can I find a reference for that?
zcoeffs(1) = 0;

% Get Zernike coefficients and add in appropriate info to defocus
% Need to make sure the c vector is long enough to contain defocus
% term, because we handle that specially and it's easy just to make
% sure it is there.  This wastes a little time when we just compute
% diffraction, but that is the least of our worries.
if (length(zcoeffs) < 5),  zcoeffs(length(zcoeffs)+1:5) = 0; end

% We don't defocus for human chromatic aberration in ISET.  But we do this
% sort of thing in ISETBio.
% zcoeffs(5) = zcoeffs(5) + lcaMicrons + defocusCorrectionMicrons;

% This loop uses the function zerfun to compute the Zernike
% polynomial of each required order. That function normalizes a bit
% differently than the OSA standard, with a factor of 1/sqrt(pi)
% that is not part of the OSA definition.  We correct by
% multiplying by the same factor.
%
% Also, we speed this up by not bothering to compute for zcoeff entries
% that are 0.
wavefrontAberrationsUM = zeros(size(xpos));
for k = 1:length(zcoeffs)

% Set values outside the pupil we're calculating for to 0 amplitude
pupilfuncphase(norm_radius > pupilSizeMM/zpupilDiameterMM)=0;
