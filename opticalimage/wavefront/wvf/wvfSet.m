function wvf = wvfSet(wvf, parm, val, varargin)
% Set wavefront parameters to use for calculations
%
% Syntax:
%   wvf = wvfSet(wvf, parm, val, [varargin])
%
% Description:
%    Key wavefront properties are stored as parameters here. Many other
%    properties are computed from these identifiable parameters using other
%    functions, such as wvfGet.
%
%    Parameter names can be written with spaces and upper/lower case. The
%    strings are converted to lower case and all the spaces are removed by
%    this routine.
%
%    When parameters that influence the pupil function are changed, 
%    wvf.PUPILFUNCTION_STALE is set too true.
%
% Inputs:
%    wvf      - The wavefront object prior to manipulation.
%    parm     - The parameter you wish to alter
%    val      - The value to assign to the parameter
%    varargin - (Optional) Character strings containing parameter key/value
%               pairs, shown below.

% Notes:
%	 05/17/12  dhb  When we pass fewer than 65 coefficients, should we zero
%                   out the higher order ones, or leave them alone?  The
%                   current code leaves them alone, which seems a little
%                   dangerous.
%              dhb  There are two underlying field sizes, one in the pupil
%                   plane and one in the plane of the retina. The pixel
%                   dimensions are implicitly linked by the conversion
%                   between pf and psf, and our conversion code uses the
%                   same number of pixels in each representation. One could
%                   get fancier and explicitly specify the units of each
%                   representation, and appropiately convert. An important
%                   consideration is for the dimensions to be chosen so
%                   that both pupil function & psf are adequately sampled.

        %% Spatial sampling parameters
        %
        % In the end, we calculate using discretized sampling. Because the
        % pupil function and the psf are related by a fourier transform, it
        % is natural to use the same number of spatial samples for both the
        % pupil function and the corresponding psf.  The parameters here
        % specify the sampling.
        %
        % Note that this may be done independently of the wavefront
        % measurements, because the spatial scale of those is defined by
        % pupil size over which the Zernike coefficients define the
        % wavefront aberrations.
        %
        % There are a number of parameters that are yoked together here, 
        % because the sampling intervals in the pupil and psf domains are
        % yoked, and because the overall size of the sampled quantities is
        % determined from the sampling intervals and the number of pixels.
        %
        % As a general matter, it will drive us nuts to have the number of
        % pixels varying with anything, because then we can't sum over
        % wavelength easily. So we set the number of number of pixels and
        % size of the sampling in the pupil plane at the measurement
        % wavelength, and then compute/set everything else as needed.
        %
        % Because the sampling in the pupil and psf domains is yoked, it is
        % important to choose values that do not produce discretization
        % artifacts in either domain. We don't have an automated way to do
        % this, but the default numbers here were chosen by experience
        % (well, really by Heidi Hofer's experience) to work well. Be
        % attentive to this aspect if you decide you want to change them by
        % very much.
        %
        % The other thing that is tricky is that the relation between the
        % sampling in the pupil and psf domains varies with wavelength. So, 
        % you can't easily have the sample interval stay constant over
        % wavelength in both the pupil and psf domains. You have to choose
        % one or the other. We will typically force equal sampling in the

        %
        % The number of arc minutes per pixel in the sampled PSF is
        % related to the number of mm per pixel for hte pupil function, 
        % with the relation depending on the wavelength. The fundamental
        % formula in the pupil plane is that the pixel sampling interval
        % in cycles/radian is:
        %
        %   pupilPlaneCyclesRadianPerPix = pupilPlaneField / ...
        %       [lambda * npixels]
        %
        % where npixels is the number of linear pixels and lambda is the
        % wavelength. This formula may be found as Eq 10 of Ravikumar et
        % al. (2008), "Calculation of retinal image quality for
        % polychromatic light, " JOSA A, 25, 2395-2407, at least if we
        % think their quantity d is the size of the pupil plane field being
        % sampled.
        %
        % If we now remember how units convert when we do the fft, we
        % obtain that the number of radians in the PSF image is the inverse

        %
        %   radiansInPsfImage = [lambda * npixels] / pupilPlaneField

        % which then gives us the number of radiansPerPixel in the PSF

        %
        %   radiansPerPixel = lambda / pupilPlaneField
        %
        % The formula below implements this, with a conversion from radians
