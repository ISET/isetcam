function [conePsf, coneSceFraction] = wvfComputeConePSF(wvf)
% Return cone PSF and cone SCE Fraction using a wavefront object with PSF
%
% Syntax:
%   [conePsf, coneSceFraction] = wvfComputeConePSF(wvf)
%
% Description:
%    This routine finds PSFs seen by each cone class under passed spectrum
%    weightingSpectrum. It gets these by taking a weighted sum of the
%    monochromatic PSFs, where the weights are given by the product of the
%    LMS spectral sensitivities and the weighting spectrum.
%
%    Note that we wouldn't generally call this directly, but rather use
%      conePsf = wvfGet(wvf, 'cone psf')
%    which in turn would call this.
%
%    The returned psfs are normalized so that they sum to unity. If you
%    want to figure out the relative amount of light seen by each cone
%    class, you need to take the spectral sensitivities into account and
%    also the SCE if you're using that.
%
%    The routine also returns the weighted average of the monochromatic
%    sceFraction entries for each cone type, to make knowing this easier.
%    We still need to do some conceptual thinking about exactly what this
%    quantity means and how to use it.
%
%    If you actually know the hyperspectral image input, you probably don't
%    want to use this routine. Rather, compute the monochromatic PSFs at
%    each wavelength and do your optical blurring in the wavelength domain, 
%    before computing cone absorbtions. Doing so is a more accurate model
%    of the physics. You would use this routine under two circumstances.
%    First, you might know that the image consists only of intensity
%    modulations of a single relative spectrum. In this case, you could
%    use that spectrum here and speed things up, since you'd only have to
%    convolve three times (one for each cone class rather than once for
%    each wavelength). This case corresponds, for example, to psychophysics
%    where achromatic contrast is manipulated. Second, you might only know
%    the unblurred LMS images and not have spectral data. Then, this
%    routine is useful for providing an approximation to the blurring that
%    will occur for each cone class. For example, your data might originate
%    with a high-resolution RGB camera image, which was then used to
%    estimate LMS values at each location. Keep in mind that what you get
%    in that case is only an approximation, since the actual blur depends
%    on the full spectral image.
% 
%    If you want to compute a strehl ratio quantity for the LMS psfs, the
%    most straightforward way is to call this routine a second time using a
%    zcoeffs vector of all zeros. This leads to computation of diffraction
%    limited monochromatic psfs that are then summed just like the
%    specified ones. Taking the ratios of the peaks then gives you a
%    fairly meaningful figure of merit.
%
%     Examples are provided in the code.
%
% Inputs:
%    wvf             - The wavefront object (with PSF already calculated)
%
% Outputs:
%    conePSF         - The normalized cone PSFs. This is returned as a
%                      matrix, with the third dimension indexing cone type.
%                      Cone types are specified by the spectral sensitivies
%                      in the wvf structures conePsfInfo structure:
%                      wvfGet(wvf, 'calc cone psf info');
%    coneSceFraction - Weighted average of the monochromatic SCE fraction
%
% Optional key/value pairs:
