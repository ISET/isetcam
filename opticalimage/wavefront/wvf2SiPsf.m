function [siData, wvfP] = wvf2SiPsf(wvfP, varargin)
% Convert a wvf structure to isetbio shift-invariant PSF data structure
%
% Syntax:
%   [siData, wvfP] = wvf2SiPsf(wvfP, [varargin])
%
% Description:
%    For each wavelength in wvfP, compute the PSF place it into an isetbio
%    (inheritied from iset) shift-invariant PSF structure that can then be
%    passed smoothly into an optical image structure in isetbio.
%
%    Note that we also have wvf2oi, which converts the PSF specified by the
%    wavefront structure into an optical image (oi) structure. That may
%    really be what you want to do.
%
%    The input wvfP is the main wavefront optics toolbox structure. The PSF
%    is computed at the wavelength values in the structure. The updated
%    structure with the PSFs can be obtained via wvfGet calls.
%
%    The output siData structure is an iset/isetbio structure that
%    describes shift invariant PSFs. We convert to this structure, because
%    then we already have code that knows how to push this into an optical
%    image structure.
%
%    You need to think a litte bit about how to choose the number of
%    samples and um per pixel onto which the PSF will be computed. For
%    human retina, there are about 300 um per degree and foveal cone
%    spacing is about 0.3 um. Typical PSFs are bigger than a cone  If you
%    use the default values of 128 samples and 0.25 um/pixel, the PSF will
%    probably be sampled OK as and captured reasonably well for many use
%    cases. But it is probably worth plotting you compute to make sure this
%    is true.
%
%    Note also that is some places, the siData structure is currently
%    assumed to have 128 samples, so changing this to be what you need
%    might cause something else to break.
%
%    If you don't want to use wvf2oi, or if you want an optics structure
%    rather than an oi, you could create the optics structure directly
%    using siSynthetic, and then stick that into an optical image
%    structure. This is illustrated in the Examples section below.
%
%    The siData-format PSF data can be saved using ieSaveSIDataFile as
%    illustrated in the Examples section below, for example if you wanted
%    to pre-compute some PSFs and then load them later.
%
% Inputs:
%    wvfP    - Wavefront Optics Toolbox structure
%    showBar - (Optional) Boolean indicating whether or not to show the
%              wait bar. The default is true.
%
% Outputs:
%    siData  - Shift-Invariant PSF format used for human optics simulation
%    wvfP    - Wavefront structure updated with PSF computed via
%              wvfP = wvfComputePSF(wvfP).  Returned only because this can
%              be a little slow and we might want it in the caller.
%
% Optional key/value pairs:
%    showBar -     Boolean, show the wait bar? (Default false)
%    nPSFSamples - Scalar, number of x and y samples to use when computing
%                  the PSF for the siData structure. (Default 128)
%    umPerSample - Scalar, number of retinal microns per PSF pixel. The
%                  same number is used for x and y. (Default 0.25)
