function wvf = wvfPupilFunction(wvf, varargin)
% Deprecated:  We now use wvfCompute() which calls wvfComputePupilFunction
% 
% Compute the pupil fuction from the wvf parameters
%
% Syntax:
%   wvf = wvfPupilFunction(wvf, varargin)
%
% Inputs:
%    wvf - The wavefront struct
%
% Optional key/value pairs:
%    aperture function - An image describing the aperture function.
%         The default amplitude across the circular pupil is assumed
%         to be 1, which would be a diffraction limited case.
%                
% Outputs:
%    wvf - The wavefront object with the updated pupilfunction.
%
% Description:
%    Compute the pupil function. This is designed for general optics.
%
%    See *wvfComputePupilFunction* for the ISETBio calculations that
%    include Stiles Crawford, human chromatic aberration and parameters
%    related to typical human pupil sizes.  That function always creates a
%    circular aperture function of ones that corresponds to the size of the
%    human pupil.
%
%    The pupil function combines the aperture function (real) and the
%    wavefront aberrations (imaginary) into a complex number that
%    represents the amplitude and phase of the wavefront across the pupil.
%    The pupil function at a specific wavelength is
%
%       pupilF = A exp(-1i 2 pi (phase/wavelength));
%
%    The pupil function is related to the PSF by the Fourier transform. See
%    J. Goodman, Intro to Fourier Optics, 3rd ed, p. 131. (MDL)  It is
%    computed using wvfComputePSF().
%
%    The wavefront aberrations in ISETCam is calculated for 10 orders of
%    Zernike coeffcients specified to the OSA standard, with the convention
%    that we include the j = 0 term, even though it does not affect the
%    psf. Thus the first entry of the passed coefficients corresponds to j
%    = 1. Adding in the j = 0 term does not change the psf. The spatial
%    coordinate system is also OSA standard.
