% Produces an average of passed optical point spread functions.
% Input is a 3D array of PSFs, with the averaging occuring over

% Setting CHECKINSFDOMAIN = 1 executes a check that you get the
% same answer by using psf2otf, averaging, and then using otf2psf.
% See comment in code as to why this might once (possibly) have been
% an interesting thing to do.

% 7/19/07  dhb  Wrote it.
% 9/9/11   dhb  Do it in the space domain, optional check in sf domain.
%          dhb  Take array, not cell array.

% Note from DHB: I really have no idea why I wrote this bit,
% as it really just verifies the the Fourier transform is
% invertible.  But now that it's here, I left it.  It may
% be that I once thought it was a good idea to average the
% modulus of the otf, and started down that road without
% going all the way down it.  If we ever want to average
% the modulus, one could start with this check code.
