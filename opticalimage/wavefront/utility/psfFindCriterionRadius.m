%
% Find the radius around the peak of the passed circularly symmetric
% PSF that includes criterion fraction [0-1] of the mass.
%
% Doesn't handle cases where PSF is super small or bigger than underlying
% grid.
%
% The passed PSF does not need to be centered or circularly averaged.

% 9/16/07  dhb  Wrote it.
% 9/18/07  dhb  Eliminate integer constraint by linear interpolation.
% 12/22/09 dhb  Fix bug in how peakRow and peakCol are computed.
% 12/22/09 dhb  Normalize here so it is more flexible.
% 08/29/11 dhb  Center here so that it need not be done on call.

% Normalize so it sums to one
