function oi = wvf2oi(wvf,varargin)
% Convert wavefront data to ISETCam optical image
%
% Syntax:
%   oi = wvf2oi(wvf)
%
% Description:
%    Convert a wavefront structure into an optical image whose optics match
%    the data in wvf.
%
%    Before calling this function, compute the pupil function and PSF,
%    using wvfCompute.
%
%    Non-optics aspects of the oi structure are assigned default values.
%
% Inputs:
%    wvf - A wavefront parameters structure (with a computed PF and PSF)
%
% Optional key/val
%
%    'human lens' - Replace the standard ISETCam lens transmittance slots
%                   with the human lens object used by ISETBio
%
% Outputs:
%    oi  - Optical image struct
%

%   oiCreate, s_wvfDiffraction
%
% Notes:
%  * BW:  ZL and I wrote the wvf2optics() method.  We needed it as part of
%     the deeper integration of wvf with oiCreate. We used it here to make
%     this function shorter and easier.
%  * BW:  The wvf2oi(wvf) function did not match the wvf and oi.  I spent a
%     bunch of time checking for the diffraction limited case on both the
%     wvf side and the oi side.  Still more to check (07.01.23). But
%     setting the umPerDeg is important (was not always done properly and
%     consistently with focal length. Also understanding the different
%     models (diffraction, humanmw, wvf human) will be important. See
%     s_wvfDiffraction.m
%  * [NOTE: DHB - There is an interpolation in the loop that computes the
%     otf wavelength by wavelength.  This appears to be there to handle the
%     possibility that the frequency support in the wvf structure could be
%     different for different wavelengths. Does that ever happen?  If we
%     check and it doesn't, I think we could save a little time by getting
%     rid of the interpolation.]
%  * [NOTE: DHB - NCP and I spent a lot of time last summer suffering
%     through the psf <-> otf calculations as part of the IBIOColorDetect
%     project, and the fftshift conventions.]
%  * [NOTE: DHB - There is a note that PSF might start real but that the
%     PSF implied by the OTF computed here might not be.  We should check
%     into that.  We don't want imaginary PSFs showing up in calculations.
%     Perhaps this is handled by the oi methods, in that perhaps they
%     enforce that the psf obtained from the otf is in fact real.]
%  * [NOTE: DHB - It might be worth checking that it is OK just to set the
%     wavelength on the OTF, even if the oi itself has different wavelength
%     sampling.]

%    01/01/18  dhb  Set name and oi wavelength from wvf.

%                   Previously this was the oi default of 3 mm pupil.
