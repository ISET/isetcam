function lcaDiopters = wvfLCAFromWavelengthDifference(...
    wl1NM, wl2NM, whichCalc)
% Longitudinal chromatic aberration (LCA), in diopters, between wavelengths
%
% Syntax:
%   lcaDiopters = wvfLCAFromWavelengthDifference(wl1NM, wl2NM, [whichCalc])
%
% Description:
%    The longitudinal chromatic aberration (LCA), in diopters, calculated
%    between two wavelengths
%
%    Either input argument may be a vector, but if both are vectors they
%    need to have the same dimensions.
%
%    Optional argument 'whichCalc' determines which of three methods are
%    used. They are supposed to give the same answer, and do to reasonable
%    approximation. The differences are just numerical roundoff. They will
%    be expanded on further in the inputs section below.
%
%    If the image is in focus at wl1NM, this provides the refractive error
%    at wl2NM.  The sign convention matches that of Figure 6 the Thibos et
%    al.% paper, so that (e.g.):
%
%      -1.7174 = wvfLCAFromWavelengthDifference(589, 400, 'thibosPaper');
%
%    The intrepretation of this is as follows.  The eye has more power at
%    shorter wavelengths, because the refractive index of the lens increses
%    relative to that in a vacuum as the wavelength becomes shorter (see
%    e.g., http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersion_(optics)). To bring the
%    image into focus, we need to decrease the power of the eye. The
%    negative number that comes out of this routine tells us what we need
%    to do to the power to bring the light at wl2NM into focus (given that
%    light at wl1NM is in focus.)
%
%    Here is what Heidi told wrote about her code:
%
%        The LCA is the difference in the focusing power of the eye at
%        different wavelengths. The majority of the eye's refracting power
%        comes from the air/cornea interface, and to a first approximation
%        the eye can be treated like a ball of water. For a single surface
%        like this the power (one over focal length) is proportional to the
%        curvature and the index of refraction (minus 1 if the cornea is in
%        air) - higher curvature corneas focus more and so have shorter
%        focal length, greater index of refraction causes the rays to bend
%        more as the enter the cornea and they focus closer to the corneal
%        surface.  The index of refraction varies with wavelength though,
%        so that shorter wavelengths always experience a higher index of
%        refraction and bend more. So there is always a difference in the
%        power with wavelength:
%    
%         F(lamda1) = (n(lamda1) - 1) * c
%         F(lamda2) = (n(lamda2) - 1) * c
%         LCA(lamda2, lamda1) = ...
%             F(lamda2) - F(lamda1) = c * [n(lamda2) - n(lamda1)]
%    
%        so you can see that the LCA (in this case written as a difference
%        in power) between two wavelengths is proportional to the corneal
%        curvature as well as the difference in corneal index of refraction
%        at the two wavelengths.  In general the difference in index of
%        refraction across the visible spectrum for the eye is not all that
%        large, and very close to what you would expect if the eye were
%        made of water. [The numbers in the first 2 equations are taken
%        from a paper by Larry Thibos and colleagues (1992, Applied Optics,
%        31, pp. 3594-3600) mainly capture effective index variation of the
%        eye with wavelength - experimentally measured - which is very
%        close to what has been measured for water. The first equation just
%        sets the constant in the second equation so that the dioptric
%        difference is zero at the nominal focus wavelength.
%
%        I do not believe you can derive the index variation analytically,
%        at least not without considering material physics that is way
%        beyond me at this point, and for the eye it may be impossible
%        anyway given the additional contributions of the lens and other
%        structures. But since the corneal curvature is so high to begin
%        with, even this small difference results in a pretty large
%        dioptric difference across the visible spectrum.  If we couldn't
%        locate our retina at the focal plane of the eye (or close anyway)
%        we would never notice the LCA, but we can, so it is important.
%
%        [There will be a wavelength dependence of the higher order
%        aberrations as well, which will probably (depends somewhat more on
%        where they are coming from since it is not such a good
%        approximation to assume they are all caused by the cornea) be of
%        similar relative magnitude, ie maybe 4%    or so across the
%        visible spectrum, but this is just not very noticeable at all
%        unless you are able to remove the mean aberration (as is the case
%        with defocus), and even then it doesn't make sense to consider
%        this difference until such a time as our error in measurement
%        decreases significantly - this is why we only focus on LCA - and
%        just let the other zernike terms stay constant with wavelength]
%
%    We also implemented what we understood from the Thibos paper and
%    verified that it gives the same answer to several places, with the
%    difference probably attributable in rounding of the constants.
%
%    The sign of the difference produced by this routine agrees with the
%    figures in the Thibos paper.
