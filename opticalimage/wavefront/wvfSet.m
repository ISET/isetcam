function wvf = wvfSet(wvf, parm, val, varargin)
% Set wavefront parameters to use for calculations
%
% Syntax:
%   wvf = wvfSet(wvf, parm, val, [varargin])
%
% Description:
%    Key wavefront parameters are stored in this struct. Many other
%    properties are computed from these identifiable parameters using other
%    functions, such as wvfGet.
%
%    Parameter names can be written with spaces and upper/lower case. The
%    strings are converted to lower case and all the spaces are removed by
%    this routine.
%
%    When parameters that influence the pupil function are changed,
%    wvf.PUPILFUNCTION_STALE is set too true.
%
%    The initial implementation separated parameters into the ones that
%    were measured and the ones we use for a calculation (from HH). In our
%    system, we mainly use the 'calc' form of the parameters.
%
% Inputs:
%    wvf      - The wavefront object prior to manipulation.
%    parm     - The parameter you wish to alter
%    val      - The value to assign to the parameter
%    varargin - (Optional) Character strings containing parameter key/value
%               pairs, shown below.
%
% Outputs:
%    wvf      - The wavefront object after manipulation
%
% Optional key/value pairs:

% Notes:
%	 05/17/12  dhb  When we pass fewer than 65 coefficients, should we zero
%                   out the higher order ones, or leave them alone?  The
%                   current code leaves them alone, which seems a little
%                   dangerous.
%              dhb  There are two underlying field sizes, one in the pupil
%                   plane and one in the plane of the retina. The pixel
%                   dimensions in these two fields are implicitly linked by
%                   the conversion between pupil function and psf, and our
%                   conversion code uses the same number of pixels in each
%                   representation. One could get fancier and explicitly
%                   specify the units of each representation, and
%                   appropiately convert. An important consideration is for
%                   the dimensions to be chosen so that both pupil function
%                   & psf are adequately sampled.

        % When we perform a calculation, we may adjust some of the
        % parameters (say the wavelength) and derive the prediction
        % correcting for these background assumptions and the calculation.
        % For example, the wavelength at calculation might differ from the
        % measured wavelength. We add a chromatic abberration correction.
        % Or the pupil size of the calculation might differ, and we account
        % for that.
        %
        % The differences are accounted for in the

        %% Zernike coefficients and related
        %
        % These specify the measured (or assumed) wavefront aberrations in
        % terms of a Zernike polynomial expansion. Exanding these gives us
        % the wavefront abberations in microns over the measured pupil.
        % That is, these coefficients are in units of microns.
        %
        % The coefficients represent measurements that were made (or
        % assumed to be made) at a particular optical axis, state of
        % accommodation of the observer, wavelength, and over a particular
        % pupil size diameter. We specify all of this size information
        % along with the coefficients, even though we don't know quite how
        % to use all of it at present.
        %
        % Zernike coeffs 0, 1, 2 (piston, verticle tilt, horizontal tilt)
        % are typically 0 since they are either constant (piston) or only
        % change the point spread location, not quality, as measured in
        % wavefront aberrations. We use the "j" single-index scheme of OSA
        % standards

        %% Spatial sampling parameters
        %
        % In the end, we calculate using discretized sampling. Because the
        % pupil function and the psf are related by a fourier transform, it
        % is natural to use the same number of spatial samples for both the
        % pupil function and the corresponding psf.  The parameters here
        % specify the sampling.
        %
        % Note that this may be done independently of the wavefront
        % measurements, because the spatial scale of those is defined by
        % pupil size over which the Zernike coefficients define the
        % wavefront aberrations.
        %
        % There are a number of parameters that are yoked together here,
        % because the sampling intervals in the pupil and psf domains are
        % yoked, and because the overall size of the sampled quantities is
        % determined from the sampling intervals and the number of pixels.
        %
        % As a general matter, it will drive us nuts to have the number of
        % pixels varying with anything, because then we can't sum over
        % wavelength easily. So we set the number of number of pixels and
        % size of the sampling in the pupil plane at the measurement
        % wavelength, and then compute/set everything else as needed.
        %
        % Because the sampling in the pupil and psf domains is yoked, it is
        % important to choose values that do not produce discretization
        % artifacts in either domain. We don't have an automated way to do
        % this, but the default numbers here were chosen by experience
        % (well, really by Heidi Hofer's experience) to work well. Be
        % attentive to this aspect if you decide you want to change them by
        % very much.
        %
        % The other thing that is tricky is that the relation between the
        % sampling in the pupil and psf domains varies with wavelength. So,
        % you can't easily have the sample interval stay constant over
        % wavelength in both the pupil and psf domains. You have to choose
        % one or the other. We will typically force equal sampling in the
        % psf domain, but we allow specification of which.

        % sampled pupil function and the sampled psf.
        %
        % The number of arc minutes per pixel in the sampled PSF is related
        % to the number of mm per pixel for the pupil function, with the
        % relationship depending on the wavelength. The formula in the

        %
        %   pupilPlaneCyclesRadianPerPix = pupilPlaneField/(lambda * npixels)
        %
        % where npixels is the number of linear pixels and lambda is the

        % al. (2008), "Calculation of retinal image quality for
        % polychromatic light, " JOSA A, 25, 2395-2407, at least if we
        % think their quantity d is the size of the pupil plane field being
        % sampled.
        %
        % Now, remember how units convert when we do the fft. The number of
        % radians in the PSF image is the inverse of the sampling interval:
        %
        %   radiansInPsfImage = [lambda * npixels] / pupilPlaneField

        %
        %   radiansPerPixel = lambda / pupilPlaneField
        %
