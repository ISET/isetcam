function [OTF2D, fSupport, wave] = humanOTF(pRadius, D0, fSupport, wave)
% Calculate the human OTF, including chromatic aberration
%
% Synopsis
%  [OTF2D, fSupport, wave] = ...
%        humanOTF([pRadius = 0.0015], [D0 = 59.9404], [fSupport = :],[wave = :])
%
% Inputs
%  pRadius  - Pupil radius in meters
%  D0       - Dioptric power (1/m)
%  fSupport - Frequency support  (cyc/deg)
%  wave     - wavelength (nm)
%
% Returns
%  OTF2D    - Two D optical transfer function for each wavelength
%  fSupport - Frequency support for row,col dimensions of OTF2D
%  wave     - wave
%
% The spatial frequency range is determined by the spatial extent and
% sampling density of the original scene.
%
% This code is based on the analysis in Marimont & Wandell (1994 --
% J. Opt. Soc. Amer. A,  v. 11, p. 3113-3122 -- see also Foundations
% of Vision by Wandell, 1995.)
%
% Reference and discussion
%
% We build the otf by first using Hopkins' formula of an eye with only
% defocus and chromatic aberration.  Then, we multiply in an estimate
% of the other aberrations.  At present, we are using some data from
% Dave Williams and colleagues measured using double-pass and
% threshold data.
%
% Williams et al. (19XX) predict the measured MTF at the infocus
% wavelength by multiplying the diffraction limited OTF by a weighted
% exponential. We perform the analogous calculation at every
% wavelength.  That is, we multiply the aberration-free MTF at each
% wavelength by the weighted exponential in the Williams measurements.
% Speaking with Dave last month, he said his current experimental
% observations confirmed that this was an appropriate correction.  (BW
% 05.24.96).
%
% As a further simplification, the human measurements are all 1D.  We
% build a 1D function and then we assume that the true function is
% circularly symmetric.  That is how we fill in the full 2D MTF.  We
% call it an OTF and assume there is no phase shift ...  All an
% approximation, but probably OK for these types of calculations.
% Further details could be sought out in the recent papers from the
% Spanish group (e.g. Artal) and from Williams and the other Hartmann
% Shack people.

% Wavelength in nanometers

% We use a frequency support that covers 60 cyc/deg.
% The frequency support runs from -60:60 by default.

end

% We treat the OTF as a circularly symmetric function.  We treat the
% effective frequency as the distance from the origin.

%  by the minimum of the two largest frequencies.  We will zero those terms
%  later.
maxF = min(maxF1,maxF2);  % Highest effective spatial freq (cyd/deg)

% The human OTF is smooth.
% To speed up calculations, we use 40 samples and interpolate the other
