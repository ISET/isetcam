%        humanCones(fileName,wave,macularDensity,includedDensity)
%
% The human cone data are read from an existing file, fileName.   We adjust
% the implicit macular density to correct for visual field position.
%
% The original human cones are built with a presumed density of 0.35. We
% strip this off and return a macular pigment free estimate (see below). Or
% we can strip off some other amount of pigment density.
%
% The macular density assumed in the foveal functions can be specified in
% includedDensity.  For the Stockman fundamentals, this value is 0.35.  I
% am not sure what it is (yet) for the Smith-Pokorny fundamentals.  So I
% will assume it is also 0.35 for now.
%
% Examples:
%   To return the cone fundamentals for a macular pigment free region, use:
%
%    [cones,macularCorrection,wave] = humanCones('stockmanAbs',370:730,0,0.35);
%
%    This returns the cones because we strip off 0.35 and then put it back.
%    [cones,macularCorrection,wave] = humanCones('stockmanAbs',370:730,0.35,0.35);
%
%    This is the cones, too
%    [cones,macularCorrection,wave] = humanCones('stockmanAbs',370:730);
%    plot(wave,macularCorrection)
%    plot(wave,cones);
