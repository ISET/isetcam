function [camera,images] = cameraComputeSequence(camera, varargin)
% Compute an image of one or more scenes shot as a sequence
% using a camera model. For example bracketing or burst photography
%
% The first half is mostly a wrapper on various bits of existing code
% but once we get back an array of images there is an opportunity for
% various approaches to combine them -- ranging from simple summation
% to alignment, tone-mapping, fancy AI stuff, and so on.
%
% I think that will either mean broadening what the IP can do, or
% adding another ISP-type element.
%
% Input:
%   camera struct, required
%
% Parameter Key/Value pairs:
%   'scenes' -- one or more scenes
%   'exposuretimes' -- one or more exposuretimes
%   'nframes' -- number of frames if different from size of scenes or
%   exposure times
%
%   History:
%       Initial coding: DJC, December, 2020
%
% check for required camera structure
if ~exist('camera', 'var') || isempty(camera), error('camera struct required'); end

% this is pretty messed up. Something better would be:

% scene = 1 exposure = n, burst photography or hdr with motionless scene
% scene = n exposure = 1, alternate type of burst photography
% scene = n exposure = n, burst or hdr photography with changing scene
% scene = n exposure = m, need to calculate what to do

% to be the same

    sensor = cameraGet(camera, 'sensor');
