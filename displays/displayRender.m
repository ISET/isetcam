%
% Synopsis
%   [displayImg,ip, Tics2display] = displayRender(icsImage,ip,sensor);
%
% Input
%   icsImage - Data in the internal color space
%   ip  - The image processor
%   sensor - The sensor
%
% Output
%   displayImg - Linear primary intensities in the display space
%   ip  - Image processor
%   Tics2display - Transform from internal color space to display
%
% Description
%  Prior to this call, the ipCompute processing pipeline transforms
%  sensor data by demosaicking, sensor conversion to the internal
%  color space, and then illuminant correction.  After illuminant
%  correction the data must be converted from the internal color space
%  to the display representation. It is the last step, from the
%  internal, calibrated space to linear display space that is
%  performed here.
%
%  The transform from the internal color space to the display values
%  is computed using ieInternal2Display.  This transform is stored in
%  the ip list of transforms.
%
%  The maximum intensity of the linear display image is set by making
%  the image data equal to the ratio of the sensor data maximum to the
%  sensor's absolute maximum. So, suppose that the the largest sensor
%  value is 0.8 volts and the voltage swing of the sensor is 1.5 volt.
%  Then, if the maximum display output is 1 (as it always is), we set
%  the maximum in this particular image to be (0.8/1.5).
%
%  The purpose of the scaling is to make sure that when we saturate the
%  sensor, the output image maps into the peak of the display response.
%
%  The linear display RGB is between 0 and 1.
