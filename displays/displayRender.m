% Prior to this call, the ipCompute processing pipeline transforms sensor
% data by demosaicking, sensor conversion to the internal color space, and
% then illuminant correction.  After illuminant correction the data must be
% converted from the internal color space to the display representation. It
% is the last step, from the internal, calibrated space to linear display
% space that is performed here.
% 
% The transform from the internal color space to the display values is
% computed using ieInternal2Display.  This transform is stored in the ip
% list of transforms. 
%
% The maximum intensity of the linear display image is set by making the
% image data equal to the ratio of the sensor data maximum to the sensor's
% absolute maximum. So, suppose that the the largest sensor value is 0.8
% volts and the voltage swing of the sensor is 1.5 volt. Then, if the
% maximum display output is 1 (as it always is), we set the maximum in this
% particular image to be (0.8/1.5).
%
% The purpose of the scaling is to make sure that when we saturate the
% sensor, the output image maps into the peak of the display response.
