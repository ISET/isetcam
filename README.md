# ISETCam

Image systems engineering toolbox for cameras.  This is the core repository including many basic routines that are used by other ISET repositories.  Shortly, say in August 2023, this repository will become necessary to run ISETBio.  It is already necessary for ISET3D, ISETAuto, ISETLens, and others.

Please see the [ISETCam wiki page](https://github.com/iset/isetcam/wiki) for more information.

This ISETCam distribution originated with the commercial product, ISET from Imageval. The ISETCam code and repositories that rely on this code have expanded significantly. For example, it is closely integrated with physically based rendering and graphics in [ISET3D](https://github.com/ISET/iset3d/wiki) and the modeling methods for the human visual encoding in [ISETBio](https://github.com/ISETBIO/ISETBio/wiki).
