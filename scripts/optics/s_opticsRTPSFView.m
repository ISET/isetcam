%% Calculating with the ray trace model (synthetic)
%
% The *ray trace* optics model is the most complex of the ISET
% optics models.  It applies a space-varying and wavelength
% dependent *point spread* functions (svPSF). These can be
% created either by calculating from a *Zemax* file, or as we do
% here, a ray trace synthetic model.
%
% The space-varying PSFs are computed and shown here.
