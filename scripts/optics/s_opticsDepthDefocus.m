%% Calculating depth of field and defocus
%
% For a thin lens, the *defocus* and *depth of field* can be calculated
% using the <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics) Lensmaker's
% Equation.>  This is quite a practical calculation these days, because
% with the advent of high quality plastic lens manufacturing for cell
% phones, the simple thin lens formulae are increasingly practical.
%
% This script generates a series of graphs that illustrate the defocus in
% diopters assuming the sensor is either at the focal length of the lens,
% or further away.  The graphs clarify how the depth of field varies as we
% change the pupil size.

%% Defocus of an object at different distances from the thin lens

% Image distance is the distance from the center of the thin lens to the
% image.  Normally the sensor is placed in this image plane.
%

% Object distance is the distance to the object.
% Here are the object distance
