% s_opticsDoF
% 
% Calculate the depth of field for a thin lens with a known focal
% length and aperture.
%
% The depth of field formula from Wikipedia is
%
%    DOF = (2 f/# C U^2)/ FocalLength^2
%
% https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_of_field
%
% It is also possible to calculate the DOF by using the opticsCoC
% calculation. We do both calculations here.
