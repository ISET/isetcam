%% Converts  an image file into ISET sensor format
%
% This script illustrate how to start with a raw image data from
% a camera, insert those data into the ISET pipeline, and then
% continue to explore using image quality evaluation and
% processing algorithms.
%
% The script loads an MCC target offered up on the Internet.  But
% the colors are not very good.  We use sensorCCM to find the
% sensor color conversion matrix.
%
% In this example, the color rendering of the original image is
% not very good, and in particular the distributed chart is
% saturated in the white regions.  So the $\Delta E$ values are
% large.
%
% ISET includes an accurate chart, which is how we can tell that
% the one from the Internet provided values that are not quite
% right.  In the last section we see that those values have been
% 'gamma corrected', so they do not reflect the true sensor
% values.  They need to be corrected by an exponent (2.2)

%% Interactively determine Color Conversion Matrix CCM

% order described in the message within the Sensor Window.  When
% you are done, right click.

% But, you can just use this rectangle which lets this script run
% without user interaction.
