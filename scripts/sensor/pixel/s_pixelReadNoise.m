%% s_sensorPixelReadNoise
%
%   Illustrate an experimental approach to measuring pixel read noise.
%
% The method is described in the paper by Farrell, Feng and Kavusi. We
% simulate a large number of short exposure durations to a black scene. The
% distribution of values to these short reads (mean and sd) define the read
% noise.  At these short times there is no dark voltage and the scene is
% black.  So read noise is all that is left to measure.
%
% There are some possible problems, however.  In particular, when the data
% are clipped at 0 the statistic is mis-estimated.  To avoid this in the
% current simulation, we use a small analog offset (which is present in
% many sensors).  You can try setting this to 0 to see the problems that
% can arise due to clipping.
%
% Under those conditions, the smallest values are clipped and the estimated
% std dev is smaller than the true read noise.  If we lift the image out of
% the darkness to a positive value, then we have photon noise.  But for
% large read noise levels, that dominates and we get an accurate estimate.
% It is hard to know where the right level is, though.  In this script, a
% mean luminance of 100 gets a good estimate, but 10 does not.
%
% Experiment to see how the methods interact with other noise terms.
%
% Also, notice that if the read noise gets too large, we clip again. Too
% many little interactions for a beautiful theory.

%% Experiment with sensor and pixel parameters
dsnuLevel = 0.0;        % Std. dev. of offset in volts

readNoise = 0.003;      % Read noise in volts   
analogOffset = 0.005;   % Analog offset (5 mv)

% Set a brief exposure time for DSNU estimation.  Because of the short
% exposure, the PRNU level is irrelevant.  The read noise can matter.  If
% it is very large, you must average over more trials.
