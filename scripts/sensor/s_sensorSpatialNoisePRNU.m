%% Problems with the experimental approach of measuring PRNU 
%
% Photoreceptor response nonuniformity (PRNU) and dark-signal nonuniformity
% (DSNU) can be estimated by measuring a uniform scene at several exposure
% levels, taking care to avoid saturatation or values near zero. Then, one
% can find the slopes of the pixel responses, normalize them, and estimate
% the PRNU from the standard deviation of these slopes.
% 
% This script simulates that approach.  It shows that the photon noise
% *corrupts* the estimate.  Even when there is 0 PRNU, the PRNU appears to
% be on the order of 2 percent in the presence of photon noise.
%
% *Further observations*
%
% Notice that the slope of the pixel response depends on the level of the
% uniform field (it will be higher on a bright field).  To normalize for
% the level of the field, specify the standard deviation of the slope as a
% percentage of the mean slope.  You can do this by dividing all the slopes
% by the mean slope before calculating the standard deviation.  The mean
% slope is always 1 volt/sec.
