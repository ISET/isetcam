%% Compute the acutance of a camera object.
%
% To simplify the code we often use the *camera object* to keep
% track of the different objects. It has slots for optics (oi)
% and the sensor and the image processor (ip).
%
% The *acutance metric* depends on the optics and sensor, but not
% the image processing steps.

%% Initialize the virtual camera.

% We illustrate the process at first by starting with the defaults.
camera = cameraCreate;
camera = cameraSet(camera,'sensor auto exposure',true);
camera = cameraSet(camera,'optics fnumber',4);

%% Slanted edge MTF test

cMTF   = cameraMTF(camera);

% This is the MTF in cpd for the luminance
lumMTF = cMTF.mtf(:,4);

% ieAddObject(cMTF.vci); ipWindow

%% Compute acutance

% cycles/mm is the default for the ISO12233 MTF.  We would like to compute
% cy/deg, which is related by cpd = (cycles/mm) *(1/degPerMM)
% For the sensor, degrees is related to distance on the sensor with respect
% to the focal distance to the optics.
oi       = cameraGet(camera,'oi');
degPerMM = cameraGet(camera,'sensor h deg per distance','mm',[],oi);
cpd      = cMTF.freq / degPerMM;

% The CPIQ is a representation of someone's idea of the human contrast
% sensitivity function.  The camera MTF is a representation of what the
% camera sees.  To compute acutance we need the cpiq and the camera MTF.
% Here, we plot the MTF and the cpiq, and then we calculate the acutance
% inside the function below.  We put this in the title of the figure.

cpiq = cpiqCSF(cpd);
