%% s_PupilSizeBlur
%
% Calculate the effect of pupil size on blur in the human retina model
% developed by Hopkins and implemented in humanCore.
%
% The human OTF that we calculate is based on two elements. The first is
% the Hopkins model of the human eye. This is an idealized eye that
% accounts for chromatic aberration, but it does not have all of the
% features needed to capture the imperfections of the constructed human
% eye.
%
% Hence, we added a second factor that degrades image quality. This comes
% from empirical measurements made in Dave Williams' lab. This reduces the
% contrast passed uniformly across all wavelengths uniformly.
%
% But the degradation that we use is not pupil size dependent.  This is a
% significant limitation in the accuracy of the model.  In fact, for an
% idealized eye as the pupil size grows, the linespread will sharpen
% because there is less diffraction to contend with.  In the real eye
% however, the data go in the other direction.  As the pupil size grows the
% eye's aberrations play a larger role and there is degradation of the
% linespread.
%
% Hence, the model we use here and in humanCore isn't handling pupil radius
% correctly (demonstrated in the calculations). The data are not bad around
% 3mm diameter, but they are too good at 6mm diameter.
%
% One way to fix this problem is to have the degradation factor we use from
% the Williams' data depend on the pupil diameter.  We should do this by
% examining  published linespreads and adjusting the variable in humanCore
% called 'williamsFactor' to be pupil size dependent. (Wandell, May, 2010).
