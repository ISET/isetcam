%  Ed Pugh wrote a document (Pugh_Summary_for_FFB.pdf) asserting that based
%  on Delori and Webb 2007 he knows that
%
% At the eye:
%   10^15 photons cm^-2 sec^-1 at 580 nm corresponds to a retinal
%   illuminance of 590,000 photopic Trolands.
%
% He then says that a photopic Troland is related to candelas/m2 by the
% principle that a 1 cd m^-2 patch seen a 1 mm^2 pupil area.  For a pupil
% that is 2 mm diameter, the area is 3.1mm^2.  So converting back to the
% scene,
%
%   590,000 Trolands at the retina at 580nm is supposed to be 190,000
%   cd/m2 at the scene
%
% This script checks these numbers by
%
% 1. Creating a 580 nm uniform scene (with some candela/m2 level)
% 2. Imaging it through a lens with a 2mm pupil, focal length of 17mm
% 3. Calculating the retinal illuminance in the optical image window
%
% According to Ed, we should find that
%     190,000 cd/m2 at 580 nm in the scene, produces
%     10^19 photons m^-2 s^-1 at the retina.
