% Where does the rule of thumb below come from?  
%
% The rough rule of thumb is 95,66,7 absorptions/sec per candela/m2 for the
% L, M and S cones.  This is governed by the scaling of the photopigment
% peaks, of course.
%
% A 100 cd/m2 5000 deg blackbody radiator causes about 10,000 absorptions
% in a second in the L cones.
