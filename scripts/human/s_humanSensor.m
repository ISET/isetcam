% We are leaving this script here as a historical artifact. At this
% point, it is best to use scripts and functions in  ISETBio for
% creating models of the human cone mosaic.  
%
% Create a sensor that models the spatial absorptions of the human cone
% mosaic.  The cone mosaic comprises randomly positioned L,M,S cones at
% some density (typically 4:2:1) and also some blank positions (K).
%
% The parameters for the cone optical and noise properties can be set as
% part of the sensor structure.

%% Create the human sensor with a size matched to the scene
% The code here illustrates the complete set of parameters to create a
% sensor mosaic that simulates the cone absorptions.
% The cone aperture is roughly the size in the fovea, though perhaps a
% bit small.  The spacing between cones is a little big.
% These are among the unknown parameters across the retinal surface.

%% Show the cone absorption counts across a horizontal image line
% The absorptions in the L,M, and S are shown as red, green and blue.  The
% black curve at the top is a measure of the typical noise we have modeled
% in the pixel and sensor parameters.  Notice the very low contrast in the
% S-cones, due to chromatic aberration.
f = sensorPlotLine(sensor,[],'electrons','space',[1 116]);

%% To retrieve and plot the L,M and S cone absorptions you can use this:
%  The absorption histograms are variable in part because of photon noise,
%  but in this implementation there is also some dark current and read
%  noise that we put into the photon noise.  It is possible to set the
%  properties of the sensor to be ideal, so that there is only photon
%  noise.

%% Create a dichromatic sensor mosaic
%  One can experiment with all kinds of different mosaic properties to
%  understand the implications of various densities, sensitivies, and noise
%  characteristics.
%  Here, I illustrate how to create a dichromatica retina. The dichromacy
%  is created because the L cone slot is 0 in rgbDensities. We could do
%  experiments trying to understand the consequences for spatial resolution
%  of missing a cone class.

params.sz =  [200 200];  % A little smaller
rgbDensities = [0 0 2 1];
