Hello Joyce,

 It is definitely pi. 
 There is 2*pi solid angle for the hemisphere, but when you integrate 
 you end up getting pi as factor.

See you next week,

Peter

Hi Peter,

Thanks so very much for giving me the conversion from radiance to
irradiance. 

is it 
E = pi*L/R (where E is irradiance, L is radiance and R is reflectance)
or
E=2pi*L/R

The maximum permissible exposure time per 8 hours for ultraviolet radiation
incident upon the unprotected eye or skin shall be computed by:

t_max = 30/E_s   (seconds) (Equation 4.2)

E_s is the effective ultraviolet irradiance (W/m^2).  The formula for E_s
is defined in Equation 4.1.  It is the inner product of the Actinic
function and the irradiance function, accounting for time and wavelength
sampling.

This calculation has no weighting function.  

For times less than 1000 sec, add up the total irradiance

Multiply by time (seconds).  The product should be less than 10,000.

For times exceeding 1000 sec, add up the total irradiance, divide by the
time, and the value must be less than 10 (Equation 4.3b).
