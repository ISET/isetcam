%% Experiment with changing the surface reflectances in the image 
%
% We use convolution by different kernels to blur the surface reflectance
% functions. The original motivation is to control the image gamut by
% blurring the reflectance functions so they become more neutral (e.g.,
% Gaussian blur).
%
% Convolving with a sharpening filter is also illustrated.  And once you
% get started, the possibility of changing the gamut by multiplying with
% with a general vector (which could be grouped into the light) also
% arises.
%
% There are many ways to change the reflectances by many other possible
% transforms that either reduce or expand the gamut in different ways.
% This script illustrates the first and simplest methods.
