%% t_displaySurfaceReflectance
%
%  We create a theoretical display for use with sceneFromFile.  The purpose
%  of the display is to create a scene radiance and illuminant from the
%  input sRGB image so that
%
%   * The illuminant is the mean CIE Daylight
%   * The scene reflectances are within the first three natural reflectance
%     function bases, reflectanceBasis.mat 
%
% Description:
%  
%   This is how we create the (theoretical) display.
%
%   * The display radiance must be within the space spanned by the Daylight
%   light times each of the three natural reflectance bases.  That way,
%   when we divide out by the light, we are left with a reflectance in the
%   natural reflectance database.
%
%   * We find a 3x3 transform from the linearized srgb values so that the
%   XYZ values of the theoretical display match the XYZ of the sRGB
%   display. This means the XYZ values on the theoretical reflectance
%   display are the same as if we had put the image up on an sRGB display.
%
%   This script can be used to write out the reflectance-basis display, but
%   the writing code is commented out below.
%
%   From the logic, you might notice that we could build a theoretical
%   display for other lights or surface basis functions.

%% Load the reflectance basis for natural surfaces

wave = 400:1:700;
basis = ieReadSpectra('reflectanceBasis.mat',wave);
basis(:,1) = -1*basis(:,1);
% plotReflectance(wave,basis(:,1:3));

%% Load the standard CIE daylight illuminant

% Loaded as energy.
illEnergy = ieReadSpectra('cieDaylightBasis.mat',wave);
% plotRadiance(wave,data);

% Loaded as energy.
% d65 = ieReadSpectra('D65.mat',wave);
% plotRadiance(wave,data);

%% Radiance basis - 3D
%
% The radiance basis must be  described by these three columns if the light
% is D65 and the surfaces are within the space spanned by the first three
% natural reflectance function bases.

radianceBasis = diag(illEnergy(:,1))*basis(:,1:3);
% plotRadiance(wave,radianceBasis);

%% Find the sRGB XYZ values

% Suppose a point in the rgb file we read is represented by the row vector,
%
%    p = [R,G,B]. 
%
% The matrix lrgb2xyz transforms the row vector, XYZ = p*lrgb2xyz;
%
lrgb2xyz = colorTransformMatrix('lrgb2xyz');

% Transposing the matrix gives us the XYZ values of the XYZ values of the
% sRGB display in the columns.
%
lXYZinCols = lrgb2xyz';

%% Find a 3x3 T such that the reflectance display and sRGB primaries match
%
% The match is with respect to XYZ.  The matrix lXYZinCols has the sRGB
% primaries in the columns.  So we want T that satisfies
%
%    lXYZinCols = XYZ'*radianceBasis*T
%
%  We will assign the reflectance-display primaries to be radianceBasis*T
%

% Read in the XYZ functions with respect to energy.
XYZ = ieReadSpectra('XYZEnergy.mat',wave);

T = pinv(XYZ'*radianceBasis)*lXYZinCols;

% We use these as the primaries of the theoretical reflectance display.
rgbPrimaries = radianceBasis*T;

% The primaries are not physically realizable (they have some negative
% entries).  But this is all simulation, so we don't care.  The scene
% radiance values for any natural image will be all positive because
% natural scenes never have [1,0,0] and the like.  If they do, then the
% image data are outside of the range of the natural reflectances under
% mean daylight illuminant.
plotRadiance(wave,rgbPrimaries);

%% Create the display

d = displayCreate('default');
d = displaySet(d,'wave',wave);
d = displaySet(d,'spd',rgbPrimaries);
displayPlot(d,'spd');
displayGet(d,'white xy')
peakL = displayGet(d,'peak luminance');

%% Set the display to a luminance of 100

rgbPrimaries = rgbPrimaries*(100/peakL);
d = displaySet(d,'spd',rgbPrimaries);
peakL = displayGet(d,'peak luminance');

%% Set the gamma of the display

% When we read in the image we will be applying the gamma correction for
% some display when we compute the radiance.  Maybe we should be using
% sRGB, which is something like 2.2 or 1.8.  For now, I inserted a measured
% gamma from an Apple display.

% Maybe we should set this based on the MCC gray series.  We know those
% reflectance levels and the horizontal luminance line should get at least
% the ratios on that right. (BW).
dApple = displayCreate('LCD-Apple');
g = displayGet(dApple,'gamma');
d = displaySet(d,'gamma',g);

%% Save the reflectance-display

%{
 % We will use this as the default display for sceneFromFile
 fname = fullfile(isetRootPath,'data','displays','reflectance-display');
 save(fname,'d');
%}

%%  Try it out

thisWave = 400:10:700;
scene = sceneFromFile('woodDuck.png','rgb',50,'reflectance-display',thisWave);
sceneWindow(scene);
