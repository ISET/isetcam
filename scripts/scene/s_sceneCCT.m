%% Correlated color temperature of a light (spectral power distribution)
%
% Calculate the *correlated color temperature* of a spectral
% power distribution.  The temperature refers to which blackbody
% (planckian) radiator is most like the light.
%
% The correlated color temperature is typically used characterize
% an illuminant.  It measures the yellow-blue appearance of the
% light.  Low temperatures (3500K) are yellowish and high
% temperatures (7000K)are bluish.  A typical mix of blue sky and
% the sun is 5500 or 6500K.
%
% The CCT calculation was developed by Wyszecki and Judd in the 1960s.  It
% relies on the old (u,v) format, not the (u',v') format.  See
% notes in the function *xyz2uv* .
%
% The function *spd2cct* names a scene illuminant by its color
% temperature.  This function is used  when the user does not
% assign a name.
