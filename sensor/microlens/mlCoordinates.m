% Programming Notes
%   We should allow an option of sending in nPoints instead of fixing it
%   inside of this routine.

% The code here was included to choose a sampling rate that would work for
% the Wigner transform case.  We are doing only ray trace at this point, so
% we felt it was safe to just set the number of sample points and ignore
% any sampling/aliasing issues for now.  If we put back the Wigner case, we
% need to reconsider this code.
% %
% % The spatial sampling rate for PS calculation is set here.  The number of
% % samples can get pretty large and slow down the calculation.  For a 8
% % micron pixel, simulated at 500 nm, the grid is about 800 x 800
% % k = 2*pi/lambda;
% % pMax = k;
% % pSample = 2*pMax;
% % xSample = 1/pSample;
% %
% % % We need a better way to decide on the number of points.  We chose this
% % % (divide by 2) by examining some results.  But we need to return to this
% % % issue.
% % nPoints = round((abs(x1)+abs(x2))/xSample);
% % nPoints = nPoints - mod(nPoints,2);
% %

% We make this odd so 0 is always one of the samples.
nPoints = 255;

% Create the x and p sample values
x = linspace(x1,x2,nPoints); y = 0;

% We set this to .99 to make sure that the angle coordinate is never out of
% the bounds of the sin function.
p = linspace(-n*0.99,n*0.99,nPoints); q = 0;

switch lower(type)
    case('angle')
        u = p; v = q;
    case('frequency')
        u = p*pMax; v = q*pMax;
end
