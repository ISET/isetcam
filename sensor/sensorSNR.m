function [SNR, volts, SNRshot, SNRread, SNRdsnu, SNRprnu] = sensorSNR(ISA,volts)
%Calculate sensor SNR over a range of voltage levels
%
%   [SNR, volts, SNRshot, SNRread, SNRdsnu, SNRprnu] = sensorSNR(ISA,volts)
%
% The formula for sensor SNR is
%
%      SNR = 10*log10(signalPower/noisePower)
%
% We compute this in units of electrons.  The definitions of signalPower
% and noisePower are:
%
%  signalPower:  the number of signal electrons squared.
%    signalPower = (volts/convGain).^2;
%
%  noisePower:   the sum of the variance of the shot noise, read noise,
%    and prnu noise.
%    noisePower = shotSD.^2 + readSD.^2 + dsnuSD.^2 + prnuSD.^2;
%
% The values are all calculated in electrons, not volts.  This is because
% the shot noise is Poisson in electrons, not volts.
%
% Various noise quantities are signal-dependent, such as the Poisson
% variability in the number of electrons (shot noise) and the
% photo-response nonuniformity (prnu).  Other noise factors are signal
% indpendent (readSD, dsnuSD).
%
% See comments in the code for more information about the calculation.
%
% If no voltage levels are sent in we calculate as a function across the
% voltage swing. This function is similar to pixelSNR, but also includes
% DSNU and PRNU.
%
% This routine can also return the SNR limits imposed by the individual
% noise sources. If the modeling sets  readSD, dsnuSD, prnuSD to  we
% return an infinite SNR.

% We compute the standard deviations in electrons for shot noise, PRNU and

% For noise we convert the voltage signal to electrons.  The mean is equal

% electrons squared.  We take the square root to obtain the SD, and this
% has units of electrons.

% Note: The PRNU contributes more noise at higher intensity levels, but in
