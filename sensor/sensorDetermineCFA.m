function [CFAletters,CFAnumbers,mp] = sensorDetermineCFA(sensor)
% Determine the CFA organization for an image sensor
%
%   [CFAletters,CFAnumbers,mp] = sensorDetermineCFA(sensor)
%
% The CFAletters is an array of sensor size contaning a string that
% characterizes the filter appearance. If the filterName first letter that
% is within the list defined in sensorColorOrder, then we use that letter.
% Otherwise, we assign the color k (black). This may encourage better
% notation.  Or, we may get annoyed with this and write a routine to
% determine a reasonable color from the filterSpectra curve.
%
% The CFAnumbers is an integer matrix with the size of sensor. The integers
% in the matrix refer to which color filter (as defined by the column
% number occupied by the color filter in the sensor data structure
% (sensorGet(sensor,'filterSpectra')).  These are the same numbers that are
% used by the field 'pattern' to define the color filter array spatial
% layout.
%
% The variable mp contains the RGB values associated with the letters that
% are present in the CFAletters.  If there are three letters, say r g and
% b, then the mp values will be
%
%        1     0     0
%        0     1     0
%        0     0     1
%
% The set of valid letter names for color filters (and their numerical
% order) is set in the function sensorColorOrder.  Type
%
%   sensorColorOrder
%
% to see the list of letters :
%    {'r' 'g' 'b' 'c' 'y' 'm' 'w' 'u' 'x' 'z' 'o' 'k'}
%
% The corresponding map RGB values for each letter are also stored in that
% routine. This mapping can be found from
%
%    [letters, mp] = sensorColorOrder;
%
% Examples:
%   sensor = vcGetObject('sensor');
%   [cfa,cfaN] = sensorDetermineCFA(sensor);
%   [cfa,cfaN,mp] = sensorDetermineCFA;
%   figure; image(cfaN); colormap(gray(64));
%
% See also: sensorColorOrder, sensorImageColorArray
%

% Programming notes We could derive a color from the spectra using simple
% methods that we apply in scripts from time-to-time.
%
% Confusingly, there are 3 different roles that in a better world would
% correspond to filterNames, filterSpectra, filterColorHint. We use
% filterNames to serve both as names and as filterColorHints also, and this
% makes things more confusing than they should be.
