function [SNR, volts, SNRshot, SNRread] = pixelSNR(sensor,volts)
%Compute pixel SNR as a function of pixel voltage
%
%   [SNR, volts, SNRshot, SNRread] = pixelSNR(sensor,volts)
%
% The pixel SNR depends on the signal level (in volts) or these can be
% stimulus referred to lux-sec (see pixelSNRluxsec). The SNR is returned in
% decibels (dB).
%
% The formula for pixel signal-to-noise ratio is
%
%    SNR = 10 * log10(signalPower./noisePower);
%
% where
%
%  signalPower:   the square of the number of electrons (volts/convGain).^2;
%
%  noisePower:    the sum of the read noise variance and shot noise
%  variance (readSD.^2 + shotSD.^2), both in electrons.
%
% If no voltage levels are passed in, we choose volts to be logarithmically
% spaced across the pixel voltage range.
%
% The limitations imposed by the different noise types (shot noise and read
% noise) can be returned, as well.
%
% See also:  pixelSNRluxsec, sensorSNR (and the comments there)
%
% Examples:
%   sensor = sensorCreate;
%   [SNR, volts] = pixelSNR(sensor); semilogx(volts,SNR);
%   [SNR, volts, SNRshot, SNRread] = pixelSNR(sensor);
%
%   vcNewGraphWin;
%   semilogx(volts,SNRshot,'g--',volts,SNRread,'r-',volts,SNR,'k-');

% Note:  (1) The argument to this routine is a sensor array with an attached pixel.
% Note:  (2) If the read SD is 0, we treat the readSNR as infinite.
