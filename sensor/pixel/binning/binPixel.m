% The voltage image should already have shot noise, dark current, and

% noises factored in.
%
% There are several different vendor methods for pixel binning.  We start
% with one implementation (kodak).  Others will follow.  See the Wiki page
% notes: http://white.stanford.edu/pdcwiki/index.php/Pixel_Binning
%
% Some of the binning methods require digital calculations after
% quantization.  These are handled in the related routine pixelBin2.
%
% Current algorithms:
%
%    kodak2008  - Adds columns in voltage, digitizes, averages digital rows
%    addAdjacentBlocks - Adds voltage values of all the R (G,B) pixels in a
%      4x4 region.
%    averageAdjacentDigitalblocks - Averages digital values of all the R
%     (G,B) pixels in a 4x4 to create a 2x2, shrinking the image size by a
%     factor of 4. Maybe this belongs in a complete post-processing
%     algorithm that would compete with sensor binning?  That group would
%     blur and sub-sample, like this.  This one blurs with a tophat
%     function.  There is also the issue of doing this prior or post
%     demosaicking.

% We define each binning function as a small matrix multiply that applies
% to the blocks of the voltage image.  In some cases the complete summing
% can happen here (e.g., addAdjacentBlocks).  In other cases we can only
% bin across the columns and the final shape of the binned image has to be
% computed in the sensorComputeBin routine, which averages the digital
% values after all the processing (e.g., kodak2008).
%
% We leave the voltage data unchanged at this point to maintain the sensor
% size and generally to inspect the voltage numbers later, if we wish. Note
% that these volts don't have the read noise.  From this point on the dv
% values become a hybrid of volts and digital values, only becoming the
% true digital values when we are done.
