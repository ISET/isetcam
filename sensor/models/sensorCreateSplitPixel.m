function sensorArray = sensorCreateSplitPixel(varargin)
% Create a split pixel pair of sensors
%
% Synopsis
%    sensorArray = sensorCreateSplitPixel(varargin)
%
% Brief
%   Split pixel sensor arrays.  Called by sensorCreateArray and the
%   image processing is implemented in sensorComputeArray.
% 
% Optional key/val
%    sensorSet parameters that do not require multiple entries
%    For example, {'exp time',0.005} works.
%
% Output
%   sensorArray - Cell array of the two sensors
%
% Description
%   The split pixel concept was introduced by Omnivision, we think.
%   There are a set of papers around 2015. Their implementation had a
%   3 capture organization, with a small PD and two reads from a large
%   PD. The Sony IMX490, which was published in 2019, had a 4-capture
%   organization. A large and small PD, each with two gains.
% 
%   We implemented both the 3- and 4-capture designs.  The detailed
%   parameters (conversion gain, analog gain, well capacity,
%   spectralQE) can be controlled in all cases, as is usual in
%   ISETCam.  The defaults are best estimates from the published
%   papers.
%
%   Sony has implemented a next generation with 9-captures (published
%   in 2023).
%
%   We implement the processing the function sensorComputeArray.
%   There are two algorithms there, and it is possible we will
%   implement some others.
%
%   To learn about image processing ideas using the split pixel, check
%   the LUCID web-site (above). They describe processing for the
%   4-capture IMX490, which has two sizes and two gains.
%
%   "The IMX490 achieves high dynamic range using two sub-pixels for each
%   pixel location which vary in sensitivity and saturation capacity. Each
%   sub-pixel is readout with high and low conversion gains giving four
%   12-bit channels for each pixel. These four channels are combined into
%   single linear 24-bit HDR value. The EMVA1288 standard is not directly
%   applicable to the 24-bit combined data, but is applicable to the
%   individual channels. Results were measured on the individual channels
%   and scaled when appropriate to reflect how the channels are combined
%   into a 24-bit HDR image"
