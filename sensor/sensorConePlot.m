function [support, spread, delta] = sensorConePlot(sensor,support,spread,delta)

%
% This should only be run when you have a human sensor based on a cone
% mosaic. This plotting routine will not run correctly (or at all) for
% non-human mosaics.
% 
% The parameters support, spread and delta define the appearance of the
% plotted cone mosaic.  Each cone is rendered as a small blurry gaussian
% with support and spread as passed in.  The spatial sampling is delta.
%
% If you are particularly interested in biological applications, then you
% might consider using ISETBIO.
