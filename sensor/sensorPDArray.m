% Create an array that measures the percentage of area of the
% photodetector contained within each square in a grid spanning the pixel
% locations.  The code is used as part of the spatialIntegration
% calculation.
%
% The spacing indicates the fineness of the grid on a unit region (i.e.,
% 1 is the center-to-center spacing between pixels.
%
% This code assumes the shape of the photodetector is row-col separable
% (i.e. a rectangle or square).
%
% When spacing ==1, this is the same as the pixel fill factor (0,1).
