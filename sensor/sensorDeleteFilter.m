function sensor = sensorDeleteFilter(sensor,whichFilter)
% Delete a color filter. 
%
% Synopsis
%   sensor = sensorDeleteFilter(sensor,[whichFilter])
%
% Brief description
%  The filterspectra, filternames and pattern fields are adjusted in a
%  sensor structure.  If whichFilter is omitted, the user is queried for a
%  filter name (a string).  The name can be seen on the sensorDesignCFA
%  plot window.
%
%  Adjustments to the pattern field may not be right because, well, who
%  knows what the user may intend?
%
% Inputs:
%   sensor:       An ISETCam sensor structure
%   whichFilter:  Integer indicating the filter (column of the filter
%                 spectra)
%
% Outputs:
%
%
% Examples:
%    [val,isa] = vcGetSelectedObject('ISA');
%    isa = sensorDeleteFilter(isa,4);
