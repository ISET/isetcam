%
% Compute the sensor voltage image from the sensor parameters and the
% optical image. This is the main computational routine used to compute
% the sensor image, and it calls a variety of sub-routines that implement
% many parts of the calculation.
%
% The spatial array of volts is routined by this routine.  In addition,
% the fixed pattern offset (dsnu) and photoresponse nonuniformity (prnu)
% can also be returned.
%
% To suppress the display of waitbars, set showWaitBar to 0.  Default is 1.
%
%   COMPUTATIONAL OVERVIEW
%
%       1.  The current generated at each pixel by the signal is computed
%       (signalCurrent).  This is converted to a voltage using the cur2volt
%       parameter.
%
%       2.  The dark voltage is computed and added to the signal.
%
%       3.  Shot noise is computed for the sum of signal and dark voltage
%       signal. This noise is added.  Hence, the Poisson noise includes
%       both the uncertainty due to the signal and the uncertainty due to
%       the dark voltage.  (It is possible to turn this off by a scripting
%       command using sensorSet(sensor,'shotNoiseFlag',0)).
%
%       4.  Read noise is added.
%
%       5.  If the sensor fixed pattern noises, DSNU and PRNU  were
%       previously stored, they are added/multipled into the signal.
%       Otherwise, they are computed and stored and then combined into the
%       signal.
%
%       6.  If column FPN is selected and stored, it is retrieved and
%       combined into the signal.  If column FPN is selected but not
%       stored, it is computed and applied. Finally, if it is not selected
%       it is not applied.
%
%   Many more notes on the calculation, including all the units are
%   embedded in the comments below.
%
%   If the waitBar handles are provided, they are used to show progress.
%   Without the waitbar handles, no waitbars are shown.
%
%  Example:
%     volts = sensorComputeImage(vcGetObject('oi'),vcGetObject('ISA'));

% This factor converts pixel current to volts for this integration time.
% The conversion units are

%
% Given the basic rule V = IR, k is effectively a measure of resistance
% that converts current into volts given the exposure duration.

% by creating a matching conversion from current to volts.

%% Etendue
% We want an array (wavelength-independent) of scale factors that account

    % pixels.  Sam Kavusi says that this variation in gain (also called
    % PRNU) is not precisely the same for signal and noise.  But we have no
    % way to assess this for most cases, so we treat the PRNU for noise and
    % signal as the same until forced to do it otherwise.

%% Apply binning method
% Many of the noises except  contribute to the individual pixel response.
% Some of the noise, however, happens after the binning. The read noise is
% after binning. The fixed pattern noise is also after binning (we think).
% We are treating the shot noise, etendue, and dark current as present in
% the individual pixels.  We then combine the charge between pixels (noise
% free combination, no noise in the binning process).  Then there is read
% noise and signal amplification (offset and gain) noise after the binning
% process. The statistics of the read noise, offset (DSNU) and gain (PRNU)
% are the same as in the general sensor specification.  They differ only by
% being applied to fewer read out values.
%
% Let's get Okincha to tell us something about this.
