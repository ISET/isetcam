function [sensor,actualFOV] = sensorSetSizeToFOV(sensor,newFOV,oi)
% Adjust sensor rows and columns so that horizontal FOV is deg (angle)
%
% Synopsis
%   [sensor,actualFOV] = sensorSetSizeToFOV([sensor],newFOV,[oi])
%
% Brief description
%    Adjust the size of the sensor to achieve a particular horizontal field
%    of view.  The scene and oi data are needed to make this adjustment
%
% Inputs
%   sensor - sensor structure
%   newFOV - Desired horizontal field of view
%   oi     - the optical image structure which includes focal length info
%
% Optional key/val pairs
%   N/A
%
% Returns
%   sensor - adjusted sensor
%   actualFOV - The adjustment can not be exact because of CFA
%     considerations; the best estimate of the actual adjustment is
%     returned.
%
% Description
%  If newFOV is a scalar, the aspect ratio of the sensor is left
%  approximately unchanged. If newFOV is a 2-vector, the values are treated
%  as (horizontal vertical) FOV and both columns and rows are changed.
%
%  The final sensor size is not always a perfect match because the final
%  size must be a multiple of the cfa size.
%
%  The FOV of the sensor depends on the focal length to the optics and the
%  size of the sensor. Hence, we normally send in the oi.  We should never
%  have to send in the scene and that will be deprecated.
% 
%  We try to handle the human cone array case, which is special, by catching
%  the string 'human' in the name and saying the block size is one.  This is
%  managed in the sensorSet/Get operations.  But human work should really be
%  in ISETBio.

    % ones. If none are selected, then it uses some arbitrary default
    % values. See the code in sensorGet.

%% Adjust FOV for CFA constraints

% The new sensor has to have at least the number of pixels in the cfa block
% pattern, and it has to be a multiple of the number of pixels in the block
% pattern.  We make it slightly larger than absolutely necessary.

% For the human photoreceptor case.
% This size adjustment can be a problem when the pattern is, say, random
% and the cfaSize is the whole size of the original array.  The size
% adjustment  is only good for block sizes that are small compared to the
% array.  

cfaSize = sensorGet(sensor,'cfaSize');
if cfaSize ~= sz
    newSize = ceil(newSize ./ cfaSize).* cfaSize;
    % If for some reason ceil(sz/cfaSize) is zero, we set size to one pixel
    % cfa.
    if newSize(1) == 0, newSize = cfaSize; end
end

% Set the new sizes.  This call considers the human case.
sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'size',newSize);

% sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'cols',newSize(2));
sensor = sensorClearData(sensor);

%%  The person may want the corrected FOV
if nargout == 2, actualFOV = sensorGet(sensor,'fov'); end
