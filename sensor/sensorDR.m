function [DR, maxVoltage, minVoltage] = sensorDR(sensor,integrationTime)
% Compute sensor dynamic range (in dB)
%
%   [DR, maxVoltage, minVoltage] = sensorDR(sensor,integrationTime)
%
%  This algorithm calculates the ratio of the maximum pixel current divided
%  by the minimum voltage. (Changed to 10 from 20 on June 26, 2024 in
%  dev-hdrsensor branch).
%
%      DR = 10 * log10(maxVoltage ./ minVoltage);
%
%  The maximum voltage is determined by the voltage swing minus the
%  darkvoltage.
%
%  The minimum voltage depends on the noise, sqrt(dkVariance + rnVariance +
%  offsetSD.^2);    Noise is measured in electrons, because these noise
%  terms are Poisson in electrons (but not in volts).
%
%  The noise is calculated as if we randomly pick a single pixel from the
%  image sensor array.  For this model, the single pixel has the noise
%  inherent in the pixel and the noise inherent in the variation across the
%  sensor array. In this model the sensor DR is smaller than the pixel DR.
%
%  Another possible sensorDR model is to assume that we are averaging
%  across some number of pixels.  In that case, the noise will go down
%  because the spatial averaging will reduce the total noise.  This model,
%  not calculated here, results in a sensor DR that exceeds the pixel DR
%  (unless DSNU is very high).
%
%  If no integrationTime is specified, the integration time from the sensor
%  in the argument to the function is used.  If no sensor is specified in
%  the calling routine, the currently selected sensor is used.
%
%  If the sensor is set to auto-exposure or 0 integration time, an empty DR
%  value is returned.
%
%  If we are using bracketed or CFA exposures the minimum and maximum DR
%  values are returned; these correspond to the shortest and longest
%  exposure times.
%
% Example:
%    sensor = vcGetObject('sensor');
%    DR     = sensorDR(sensor,0.10)
%    [DR, maxV, minV] = sensorDR(sensor);
