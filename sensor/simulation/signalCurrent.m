function signalCurrentImage = signalCurrent(oi,sensor,wBar)
% Compute the signal current at each pixel position
%
%      signalCurrentImage = signalCurrent(opticalImage,ISA,wBarHandles)
%
%  The signal current is computed from the optical image (OI) and the image
%  sensor array properties (ISA). The units returned are Amps/pixel =
%  (Coulomb/sec)/pixel.
%
%  This is a key routine called by sensorComputeImage and sensorCompute.
%  The routine can compute the current in either the default spatial
%  resolution mode (1 spatial sample per pixel) or in a high-resolution
%  made in which the pixel is modeled as a grid of sub-pixels and we
%  integrate the spectral irradiance field across this grid, weighting it
%  for the light intensity and the pixel.  (The latter, high resolution
%  mode, has not been much used in years).
%
%  The default or high-resolution mode computation is governed by the
%  nSamplesPerPixel parameter in the sensor
%
%        sensorGet(sensor,'nSamplesPerPixel');
%
%  The default mode has a value of 1 and this is the only mode we have used
%  for many years.  Even so, high resolution modes can be computed with
%
%     sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'nSamplesPerPixel',5) or some other value.
%
%  If 5 is chosen, then there is a 5x5 grid placed over the pixel to
%  account for spatial sampling.
%
%  wBar is the handle to the waitbar image.
