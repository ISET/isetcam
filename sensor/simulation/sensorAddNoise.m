function sensor = sensorAddNoise(sensor)
% Add electrical and photon noise to the sensor voltage image
%
% Synopsis
%    sensor = sensorAddNoise(sensor)
%
% Brief
%  The sensor structure enters with the mean voltage image (without
%  noise). Here, we compute the photon noise, sensor electrical noise,
%  and quantization error here and add them into the voltage image.
%
% Input
%   sensor
%
% Output
%   sensor - volts has been modified to account for noise
%
% Description
%  Certain noise terms (fixed pattern noise, seed parameters) are
%  stored and returned in the sensor structure that is returned.
%  Hence if you want to run exactly the same noise simulation again,
%  you can do it by calling the function with 
% 
%    sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'reuse noise', true);
%
%  Then it will use the stored seed parameter.
%
%  An important reason for this routine is to generate multiple
%  (noisy) samples of the same mean image.  This can happen for burst
%  photography or bracketed exposures.
%
% IMPORTANT NOTE:
%   The sensor parameter noiseFlag impacts which noise is included.
%
%  -2 - Shot noise only
%   0 - No noise at all
%   1 - Shot noise and FPN
%   2 - Shot noise and electronic noise and FPN
%
% Additional processing (analog gain/offset, clipping, quantization
% called FPN) is handled in the main sensorCompute routine.

%% Initialize

% We create a noise parameter structure
pixel = sensorGet(sensor,'pixel');

% 0 no noise
% 1 Photon noise
% 2 Photon and electronic noise
noiseFlag = sensorGet(sensor,'noise Flag');

if noiseFlag == 0, return; end

%% Manage noise reuse

% Random noise generator seed issues must be handled here.  This is tough
% to make sure we can absolutely replicate the noise to test code accuracy.
if sensorGet(sensor,'reuse noise')
    % Get the state stored in the sensor
    noiseSeed = sensorGet(sensor,'noise seed');
    if isempty(noiseSeed)
        warning('sensorAddNoise:NoPreviousNoise','No previous noise. Initiating new seed');
        try noiseSeed = rng;
        catch err
            noiseSeed = randn('seed');
        end
        sensorSet(sensor,'noise seed',noiseSeed);

        % Initialize with current seed.
        try  rng(noiseSeed);

    end
    
    % We should really get rid of the stored dsnu/prnu images. Although
    % we might decide we want it transiently so we can plot it or check it.
    % So it is still in the structure, but not used in any computational
    % path.
    sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'dsnu image',[]);
    sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'prnu image',[]);

    % Not reusing.  But remember the initial noise state for this
    % calculation 
    try noiseSeed = rng;
    catch err
        noiseSeed = randn('seed');

    sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'noise seed',noiseSeed);

%% Include the noise for each of the exposures

% Typically there is only 1, but we do have bracketing and other
% multiple exposure cases.
nExposures = sensorGet(sensor,'nExposures');
eTimes = sensorGet(sensor,'exposure times');
volts = sensorGet(sensor,'volts');

for ii=1:nExposures
    
    vImage = volts(:,:,ii);
    
    % Add the same dark voltage to all pixels. Later, we apply the
    % PRNU gain factor to the sum of the signal and noise, so that the
    % dark voltage effectively varies across pixels.
    %
    % We add the dark voltage into the signal and we treat the (small
    % amount of) dark voltage variation as if it has the same noise as
    % the shot noise, arising from the photons.
    %
    % Sam Kavusi says that the variation in gain (also called PRNU) is
    % not precisely the same for signal (photons) and noise.  But we
    % have no way to assess this for most cases. So, we treat the PRNU
    % for noise and signal as the same.
    if noiseFlag == 2
        % Treating the dark voltage as if it were caused by light.
        vImage = vImage + pixelGet(pixel,'dark Voltage')*eTimes(ii);
        sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'volts',vImage);
    end
    
    % Shot noise.
    vImage = noiseShot(sensor);

    % Add the read noise
    if noiseFlag == 2
        vImage = vImage + (pixelGet(pixel,'read noise volts') * randn(size(vImage)));
    end
    
    sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'volts',vImage);

    %% PRNU DSNU

    if noiseFlag == 1 || noiseFlag == 2
        vImage = noiseFPN(sensor);
        sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'volts',vImage);

        %% Column fixed pattern noise
        vImage = noiseColumnFPN(sensor);
        % sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'volts',vImage);
    end

    % That's is.  Store it in the volume image ...
    volts(:,:,ii) = vImage;
