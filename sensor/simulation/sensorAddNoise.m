function sensor = sensorAddNoise(sensor)
% Add electrical and photon noise to the sensor voltage image
%
%    sensor = sensorAddNoise(sensor)
%
% Typically, the sensor structure contains the mean voltage image (without
% noise). Here, we compute the photon noise, sensor electrical noise, and
% quantization error here and add them into the voltage image.
%
% Certain noise terms (fixed pattern noise, seed parameters?) are stored
% and returned in the sensor structure that is returned.  Hence if you want
% to run exactly the same noise simulation again, you can do it by calling
% the function with these seed and related parameters.
%
% An important reason for this routine is to let us generate multiple
% (noisy) samples of the same mean image.
%
% IMPORTANT NOTE:
% noiseFlag cases that are correctly handled.
%   0 - No noise at all
%   1 - Photon noise only
%   2 - Photon noise and electronic noise
% We are not sure whether the -1 and -2 cases are handled correctly.
%
% Additional imperfections (analog gain/offset, clipping, quantization) are
% handled in the main sensorCompute routine.  The inclusion of these
% operations are managed by other values of the noiseFlag.

%% Add noise

% We create a noise parameter structure
pixel = sensorGet(sensor,'pixel');

% 0 no noise
% 1 Photon noise
% 2 Photon and electronic noise
noiseFlag = sensorGet(sensor,'noise Flag');

if noiseFlag == 0, return; end

% Random noise generator seed issues must be handled here.  This is tough
% to make sure we can absolutely replicate the noise to test code accuracy.
if sensorGet(sensor,'reuse noise')
    % Get the state stored in the sensor
    noiseSeed = sensorGet(sensor,'noise seed');

        % Initialize with current seed.
        try  rng(noiseSeed);
        catch err

        end
    end
    
    % We should really get rid of the stored dsnu/prnu images. Although
    % we might decide we want it transiently so we can plot it or check it.
    % So it is still in the structure, but not used in any computational
    % path.

    % Add the dark current At this point the noise dark current is the same
    % at all pixels. Later, we apply the PRNU gain factor to the sum of the
    % signal and noise, so that the noise dark current effectively varies
    % across pixels.  Sam Kavusi says that this variation in gain (also
    % called PRNU) is not precisely the same for signal and noise.  But we
    % have no way to assess this for most cases, so we treat the PRNU for
    % noise and signal as the same until forced to do it otherwise.
