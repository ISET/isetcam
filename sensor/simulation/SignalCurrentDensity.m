%
%  This image has a spatial sampling density equal to the spatial sampling
%  of the scene and describes the current per meter^2 (A/m^2)
%
%  We perform the calculation two ways, depending on image size. If the
%  image is less than 512x512, we calculate using a quick matrix
%  multiplication.  To restrict memory use, if the optical image exceeds
%  512x512, we loop through the wavebands.  Slower, but it means the memory
%  used stays below 64MB
%
% Computational steps:
%
%   The irradiance image in photons (quanta) is multiplied by the spectral
%   QE information. 
%
%   The calculation treats the input data as photons, estimates the
%   fraction of these that are effective, and then turns this into a charge
%   per unit area.  
%
%   Subsequent calculations account for the photodetector area.
%
%   There are many comments in the code explaining each step.
