% Use the noiseFlag here for God's sake
% There are different conditions that should be matched with what we do in
% sensorCompute
%

%% Sensor electrical and photon noise
% If the user doesn't want any noise, they should not be here at all.  That
% condition should be tested in the sensorCompute, before we get here.  If
% we get here, we definitely get photon (shot) noise.  But we might turn
% off the electronic noise, which is specified in another flag.
sensor = sensorAddNoise(sensor);

%% Analog gain simulation
% We check for an analog gain and offset.  For many years there was no
% analog gain parameter.  This was added in January, 2008 when simulating
% some real devices. The manufactureres  Were clamping at zero and using
% the analog gain like wild men, rather than exposure duration. We set it
% in script for now, and we will add the ability to set it in the GUI
% before long.  If these parameters are not set, we assume they are
% returned as 1 (gain) and 0 (offset).

ao = sensorGet(sensor,'analog offset');
if ag ~= 1 || ao ~= 0
    volts  = sensorGet(sensor,'volts');
    volts  = (volts + ao)/ag;
    sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'volts',volts);
end


%% Clipping
% We clip the voltage because we assume that everything must fall between 0
% and voltage swing.
pixel  = sensorGet(sensor,'pixel');
vSwing = pixelGet(pixel,'voltage swing');
sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'volts',ieClip(sensorGet(sensor,'volts'),0,vSwing));

%% Quantization
% Compute the digital values (DV).   The results are written into
% sensor.data.dv.  If the quantization method is Analog, then the data.dv
% field is cleared and the data are stored only in data.volts.
