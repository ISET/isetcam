function [noisyImage,theNoise] = noiseShot(ISA)
% Add shot noise (Poisson electron noise) into the image data
%
%    [noisyImage,theNoise] = noiseShot(ISA)
%
% The shot noise is Poisson in units of electrons (but not in other units).
% Hence, we transform the (mean) voltage image to electrons, create the
% Poisson noise, and then the signal back to a voltage. The returned
% voltage signal is not Poisson; it has the same SNR (mean/sd) as the
% electron image. 
%
% This routine uses the normal approximation to the Poisson when there are
% more than 25 electrons in the pixel.  It uses the Poisson distribution
% when there are fewer than 25 electrons.  The Poisson function we have is
% slow for larger means, so we separate the calculation this way.  If we
% have a fast Poisson generator, we could use it throughout.  Matlab has
% one in the stats toolbox, but we don't want to impose that on others.

% N.B. The noise is Poisson in electron  units. But the distribution in
% voltage units is NOT Poisson.  The voltage signal, however, does have the
% same SNR as the electron signal.

% The Poisson variance is equal to the mean. Randn is unit normal (N(0,1)).
% S*Randn is N(0,S). 
%
% We multiply each point in the image by the square root of its mean value
% to create the noise. For most cases this Normal approximation is
% adequate. But we trap (below) the cases when the value is small and
% replace it with the Poisson random value.
theNoise = sqrt(electronImage) .* randn(size(electronImage));

% We add the mean electron and noise electrons together. 
noisyImage = round(electronImage + theNoise);
 
% Now, we find the small mean values and create a Poisson sample. This is
% too slow in general because the Poisson algorithm is slow for big
% numbers.  But it is fast for small numbers. We can't rely on the Stats
% toolbox being present, so we use this Poisson sampler from Knuth. Create
% and copy the Poisson samples into the noisyImage
