function [noisyImage,dsnuImage,prnuImage] = noiseFPN(sensor)
% Include dsnu and prnu noise into a sensor image
%
%    [noisyImage, dsnuImage, prnuImage] = noiseFPN(sensor)
%
%  This routine adds the dsnu and prnu noise.  (Shot noise is added
%  in noiseShot).
%
%  The DSNU and PRNU act as an additive offset to the voltage image (DSNU)
%  and as a multiplicative gain factor (PRNU).  Specifically, we first
%  compute the mean voltage image.  Then we transform the mean using
%
%      outputVoltage = (1 + PRNU)*meanVolt + DSNU
%
%  where DSNU is a Gaussian random variable with a standard deviation
%  obtained by sensorGet(sensor,'dsnuSigma').  The PRNU is also a Gaussian
%  random variable with a standard deviation of
%  sensorGet(sensor,'prnuSigma'). The dsnuSigma and prnuSigma are set in
%  the sensor window interface.
%
%  This routine permits a zero integration time so that it can be used  for
%  CDS calculations.  In this case, when sensor.integrationTime = 0, no
%  prnuImage is returned because, well, there is no gain.
%
%  In the past, we sometimes stored the DSNU or PRNU image for reuse.
%  Starting July 2011, we moved to always regenerating but setting an
%  initial seed so that we can regenerate all of the noise in exactly the
%  same way.  It may be that we end up having a couple of noise states so
%  that portions of the noise can be generated the same and others not.  We
%  will see.
