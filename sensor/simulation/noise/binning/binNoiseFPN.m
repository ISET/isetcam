% Include dsnu and prnu noise into a sensor image
%
%    [noisyImage,offsetFPNImage,gainFPNImage] = binNoiseFPN(ISA)
%
%  This routine adds the dsnu and prnu noise.  (Shot noise is added
%  in noiseShot).
%
%  The DSNU and PRNU act as an additive offset to the voltage image (DSNU)
%  and as a multiplicative gain factor (PRNU).  Specifically, we first
%  compute the mean voltage image.  Then we transform the mean using
%
%      outputVoltage = (1 + PRNU)*meanVolt + DSNU
%
%  where DSNU is a Gaussian random variable with a standard deviation
%  obtained by sensorGet(ISA,'dsnuSigma').  The PRNU is also a Gaussian
%  random variable with a standard deviation of sensorGet(ISA,'prnuSigma').
%  The dsnuSigma and prnuSigma are set in the sensor window interface.
%
%  This routine permits a zero integration time so that it can be used  for
%  CDS calculations.  In this case, when ISA.integrationTime = 0, no
%  gainFPNImage is returned because, well, there is no gain.
