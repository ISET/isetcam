function [flatSCDI, newRows, newCols] = regridOI2ISA(scdi,oi,sensor,spacing)
% Regrid current density in OI coordinates into sensor coordinates
%
% Syntax:
%   [flatSCDI, newRows, newCols] = regridOI2ISA(scdi,oi,sensor,spacing)
%
% Inputs:
%    scdi:    signal current density image
%    oi:      optical image
%    sensor:  Sensor
%    spacing:
%
% Outputs:
%   flatSCDI: the resampled signal current density image at the
%             spatial sampling resolution of the sensor.
%   newRows: the spatial positions, in meters, of the sampled points,
%            where (0,0) is the center of the image sensor array.
%   newCols:  as above
%
% Note:  ISA means image sensor array.  We shifted to using "sensor" now.
%
% The spatial samples in the signal current density image (scdi) are
% represented on a grid determined by the optical image sampling.  This
% routine regrids the scdi spatial samples into the spatial sample
% positions of the sensor pixels.
%
% Both the scdi (and OI) and the sensor samples are specified in units of
% microns. This routine linearly interpolates the scdi samples to a grid
% where integer values correspond to the spatial sample positions of the
% sensor pixels.  The routine uses Matlab's interp1 routine.
%
% This regridding of the representation is needed to calculate the overlap
% of the signal with the photodector, which only occupies a fraction of the
% pixel area.
%
% The input arguments are the signal current density image (scdi), optical
% image (oi), sensor and the spacing of the interpolated image that is
% returned (flatSCDI).
%
% In earlier versions of ISET, we used very high sampling resolution
% (spacing = 0.2, meaning we represented the flatSCDI so that there
% were 25 samples within the area of each pixel).  That was slow and
% did not significantly add to the precision.  So around 2002, we
% shifted to a default spacing of 1 sample per pixel (see the routine
% spatialIntegration).  It is possible, however, to set the spacing
% from the GUI to a finer spacing.
%
% In 2019 Zheng Lyu and BW enabled using an interpolation method to
% average over more of the irradiance, simulating the integration
% across the pixel aperture.

    % The logic of the Gaussian blur is this
    %
    % Suppose the number of OI samples per sensor pixel is bigger than 1
    %
    %        |  |  |  |  |  |  |    OI
    %              ---------
    %             |         |
    %             |  Pixel  |
    %             |         |
    %
    % In this case, the linear interpolation between the two OI samples
    % near the center of the pixel is not really what we want.  We want the
    % average across all the OI samples within the pixel.  So we blur
    % by a number of samples that equals the width of the pixel.
    %
    % We could conditionalize the blurring in this way
    %
    if (heightSamplesPerPixel > 1 || widthSamplesPerPixel > 1) && ...
            (isfield(sensor,'interp') && ~isequal(sensor.interp,'linear'))

    % But, when the OI samples are more widely spaced than the pixel
    % size, the Gaussian is basically an impulse and has no impact.
    % So, we haven't written the code to distinguish, we just let the
    % convolution run in both cases, knowing that when there are few
    % samples per pixel the blur is irrelevant
    %
