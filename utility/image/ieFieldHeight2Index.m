function [idx1,idx2] = ieFieldHeight2Index(fieldHeightList,height)
% Find the field height index closest to a specific height (meters)
%
%    [idx1,idx2]  = ieFieldHeight2Index(fieldHeightList,height)
%
% You can also request a pair of indices that bound the value.  In that
% case, idx1 < idx2 and
%
%     fieldHeightList(idx1) <= height <= fieldHeightList(idx2)
%
% Typically the field heights are in meters and the request is in meters.
% This routine will run correctly as long as fieldHeightList and height are
% both in common units.  If they are in different units, bad things happen.
%
% Example (in meters)
%   fieldHeightList = opticsGet(optics,'rtPSFfieldHeight');  % meters
%   fhIdx = ieFieldHeight2Index(fieldHeightList,2e-4)
%   [idx1,idx2]  = ieFieldHeight2Index(fieldHeightList,2e-4)
%
%  Or run in millimeters -
%   fieldHeightList = opticsGet(optics,'rtPSFfieldHeight','mm');
%   fhIdx = ieFieldHeight2Index(fieldHeightList,0.2)
