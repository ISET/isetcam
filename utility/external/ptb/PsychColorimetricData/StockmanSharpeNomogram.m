function T_absorbance = StockmanSharpeNomogram(S,lambdaMax)
% T_absorbance = StockmanSharpeNomogram(S,lambdaMax)
%
% Compute normalized absorbance according to the
% nomogram provided by Stockman and Sharpe:
%   See Stockman & Sharpe (2000), p. 1730 or http://www.cvrl.org/.
%
% The lmax values of the fitted templates that best fits
% to the Stockman and Sharpe (2000) S-, M- and L-cone photopigment
% spectra are 420.7, 530.3 and 558.9 nm for the
% S-, M- and L-cones, respectively;
%
% The result is in quantal units, in the sense that to compute
% absorptions you want to incident spectra in quanta.
% To get sensitivity in energy units, apply EnergyToQuanta()
% (not QuantaToEnergy, because here you are converting sensitivity
% rather than spectra.)
%
% Argument lambdaMax may be a column vector of wavelengths.
%
% This routine converts the log10 absorbance computed by the nomogram
% formulae into absorbance.
%
% Note from DHB. By eye, this nomogram gives a good fit to the log10 LMS pigment
% absorbance spectra when you plot them on a log scale over 8 log units,
% as in Stockman & Sharpe (2000), Figure 12.  The fit does not look quite so
% good in my hands on a linear scale or an expanded log scale.
% I think the deviations occur in part because the tabulated
% photopigment absorbances for the L are a mixture of the ser/ala
% pigments, and the nomogram was developed in part on the basis of fitting these
% as if they corresponded to a single lambda max value. It may also be that
% the template was built by minimizing the error in log sensitivity, and this
% would more heavily weight the long wavelength limbs of the pigments, where
% the linear sensitivity is essentially zero.  In any case, though, if you
% are working in the land of the CIE 170-1:2006 fundamentals, this is the
% probably the best current nomogram to use.
