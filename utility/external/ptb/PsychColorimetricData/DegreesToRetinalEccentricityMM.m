function eccMm = DegreesToRetinalEccentricityMM(eccDegrees,species,method,eyeLengthMm)
% eccMm = DegreesToRetinalEccentricityMM(eccDegrees,[species],[method],[eyeLengthMm])
%
% Convert eccentricity in degrees to retinal eccentricity in mm.   By
% default, this takes into account a simple model eye, rather than just
% relying on a linear small angle approximation.
%
% Input:
%   eccDegrees -- retinal eccentricity in degrees
%   species -- what species
%     'Human'  -- Human eye [default]
%     'Rhesus' -- Rhesus monkey
%   method -- what method
%     'DaceyPeterson'  -- formulae from Dacey & Peterson (1992) [default]
%     'Linear' -- linear, based on small angle approx
%  eyeLengthMm -- Eye length to assume for linear calculation, should be
%      the posterior nodal distance. Defaults to the default values returned
%      by function EyeLength for the chosen species.
%
% The Dacey and Peterson formulae are based on digitizing and fitting
% curves published by
%    1) Drasdo and Fowler, 1974 (British J. Opthth, 58,pp. 709 ff., Figure 2,
%    for human.
%    2) Perry and Cowey (1985, Vision Reserch, 25, pp. 1795-1810, Figure 4,
%    for rhesus monkey.
% These curves, I think, were produced by ray tracing or otherwise solving
% model eyes.  The eyeLengthMm parameter does not affect what this method
% does.
%
% The default eye length returned by EyeLength for Human is currently the Rodiek value of
% 16.1 mm.  Drasdo and Fowler formulae are based on a length of about this,
% so the linear and DaceyPeterson methods are roughly consistent for small
% angles.  Similarly with the Rhesus default.  Using other EyeLength's will
% make the two methods inconsistent.
%
% The Dacey and Peterson equations don't go through (0,0), but rather
% produce a visual angle of 0.1 degree for an eccentricity of 0.  This
% seems bad to me. I modified the formulae so that they use the linear
% approximation for small angles, producing a result that does go through
% (0,0).  This may be related to the fact that there is some ambiguity in
% the papers between whether the center should be thought of as the fovea
% or the center of the optical axis.  But I think this difference is small
% enough that the same formulae would apply across such a shift in origin.
%
% I digitized Drasdo and Fowler Figure 2 and compared it to what this
% routine produces.  I'd call agreement so-so, but considerably better than
% what the linear approximation produces.  One could probably do better,
% but my intuition is that the deviations are small compared to eye to eye
% differences and differences that would be produced by different model
% eyes, so that juice isn't worth the squeeze.  I pasted my digitization at
% the end of DegreesToRetinalEccentricity if anyone wants to fuss with
% this.  But probably if you're going to do that, you should do the whole
% ray tracing thing with our best current model eye.
%
% I have not checked the fit to the Perrry and Cowey curve for Rhesus
% against a digitization of that figure.
