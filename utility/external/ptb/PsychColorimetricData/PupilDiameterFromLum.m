%
% Compute pupil diameter and area from photomic luminance.
% Diameter is in mm, area in mm^2.
% Luminance is in cd/m2.
% Also returns photopic trolands.

%
% Notes:
% 	a) The calculations of the DeGroot/Gebhard formula do not seem to agree with the
%		same calculations as expressed in Figure 2(2.4.5) on the same page of W+S.  One would
%		need to go back to the original literature to sort out what is going on.
%
% 	b) In terms of the different methods, Joel Pokorny (1999, personal communication) says:
%		The average pupil diameter/luminance functions in the literature vary enormously.
%		This can be seen in the figures in
%
%			Moon, P. and D. E. Spencer (1944). "On the Stiles-Crawford Effect."
%			Journal of the Optical Society of America 34: 319-329.
%
%		and
%
%			de Groot, S. G. and J. W. Gebhard (1952). "Pupil size as determined
%			by adapting luminance." Journal of the Optical Society of America
%			42: 492-495.
%
%		For example, the Reeves (1918, "The visibility of radiation." Transactions of the
%		Illuminating Engineering Society 13: 101-109) pupil diameter function is displaced
%		roughly 1.5 log units higher on the luminance axis than Crawford's (1936, "The dependence
%		of pupil size upon external light stimulus under static and variable conditions."
%		Proceedings of the Royal Society B (London) 121(B): 376-395) average data.
%
% 	Both Moon and Spenser & DeGroot and Gebhard sought functions which were compromises
%		between existing data sets.  LeGrand's function shows good correspondence with
%		the Reeves' data.  These three functions nominally describe pupil behavior for binocular
%		view of large fields.  In vision science we most frequently use fields of limited extent
%		and often use monocular view.  These stimulus manipulations lead to larger pupils than
%		the binocular large field condition.  Thus it made sense to me to use the LeGrand function.
%		As is mentioned in "How much light..." pupil size varies for all sorts of reasons and any
%		estimate should be viewed as having a large tolerance.
