% This folder holds colorimetric data in .mat file form.
% All data files are in a standard format.
%
% A very useful source for on-line
% colorimetric data is the CVRL database:
%   http://cvrl.ioo.ucl.ac.uk/
% Many of the functions used here were downloaded from
% that source and then splined to the wavelength sampling
% used here (with extension by zeros).
%
%   B_xxx files contain basis functions.  The basis functions themselves
%     are in the columns of a matrix with name B_xxx.  There is also
%     a 3 by 1 row vector S_xxx that contains the wavelength sampling
%     information in the form [start delta numberSamples] where start
%     and delta are in nanometers.
%
%   den_xxx files contain optical density data.  In log units.  To
%     convert density values to transmittance, take 10^(-den).  There
%     is also an S_xxx vector.  Curiously, these are in column vectors
%     in the .mat files.
%
%   spd_xxx files contain spectral power distributions.  Data are in
%     columns of matrix with name spd_xxx.  There is also a S_xxx
%     vector.
%
%   sur_xxx files contain surface reflectance functions (range 0-1).  Data
%     are in columns of matrix with name sur_xxx.  There is also an S_xxx
%     vector.
%
%   T_xxx contain color matching functions or spectral sensitivities.  Data
%      are in rows of a matrix with name T_xxx.  There is also an S_xxx
%      vector.  All are in energy units, so that multiplying by spectra in
%      energy (not quanta) gives desired result (often proportional to
%      isomerization rate).
%
%  Specific data files are listed below.  Most, but not all, are sampled
%  between 380 nm and 780 nm at 5 nm intervals (S = [380 5 81]).  This is
%  the CIE standard.  Good coding practice requires using the S_xxx vector
%  loaded with the data and splining to the wavelength sampling you want to work
%  in.  If I were to start this database again, I would have kept each function
%  at the resolution of its source.
%
%  In some cases, the original data were interpolated or extraploated (with zeros)
%  to put them data onto the CIE standard [380 5 81] wavelength.
