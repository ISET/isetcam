function eyeLengthMM = EyeLength(species,source)
% eyeLengthMM = EyeLength(species,source)
%
% Return the length of the eye in mm.  Length is taken as distance
% between nodal point and fovea.  For foveal stimuli, this length
% may be used to convert between degrees of visual angle and mm/um
% of retina.  Since the nodal point isn't at the center of eye,
% the same conversion doesn't work for extrafoveal stimuli.
%
% Supported species:
%		Human (Default), Rhesus, Dog
%
% Supported sources:
%   LeGrand (Human, 16.6832 mm, Default)
%   Rodieck (Human, 16.1 mm)
%   Gulstrand (Human, 17 mm)
%   PerryCowey (Rhesus)
%   Packer (Rhesus)
%   PennDog (Dog)
%   None
%
% Passing a numeric value as source returns that value as the
% estimate, independent of species.  This is a hack that allows
% some debugging.
%
% Passing a string that is a number (that is, something that str2num
% will turn into a number) as the source will cause that number to
% be returned as the eye length.  This is a bit redundant with the
% numeric option above.
%
% Passing None is appropriate as an error check -- if a calculation
% uses the eye length when none is passed, NaN's will show up in
% the answer.
%
% Finally, if you pass a decimal number as a string, this value
% will be returned.  Useful for passing arbitrary numbers through
% routines that rely on this function.

% 7/15/03  dhb  Wrote it.
% 2/27/13  dhb  Added 17 mm option
% 3/1/13   dhb  Changed '17' to 'Gulstrand'
%          dhb  Added option of passing a number as a string.
% 4/12/13  dhb  Fix bug introduced in previous update, which may have
%               been Matlab version dependent.
% 8/9/13   dhb  A few more comments.
