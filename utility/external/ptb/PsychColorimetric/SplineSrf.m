%   extend == 0: Cubic spline, extends with zeros [default]
%   extend == 1: Cubic spline, extends with last value in that direction
%   extend == 2: Linear interpolation, linear extrapolation
%
% srf_in may have multiple columns, in which case srf_out does as well.
%
% wls_in and wls_out may be specified as a column vector of
% wavelengths or as a [start delta num] description.
