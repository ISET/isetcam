function XYZ = uvYToXYZ(uvY, compute1960)

%
% Compute tristimulus coordinates from chromaticity and luminance.
%
% These are u',v' chromaticity coordinates in notation
% used by CIE.  See CIE Colorimetry 2004 publication, or Wyszecki
% and Stiles, 2cd, page 165.
%
% Note that there is an obsolete u,v chromaticity diagram that is similar
% but uses 6 in the numerator for u rather than the 9 that is used for u'.
% See CIE Coloimetry 2004, Appendix A, or Judd and Wyszecki, p. 296. If
% you want this (maybe to compute correlated color temperatures), you can
% pass this as 1.  It is 0 by default.

%% Handle optional arg
if (nargin < 2 || isempty(compute1960))
    compute1960 = 0;
end

%% To handle 1960 input, take advantage of
% fact that all we need to do is scale v
% to get v'.  Then everything else flows
% as if we had passed u',v'.
if (compute1960)
    uvY(2, :) = uvY(2, :) * (9 / 6);
end

%% Do the computation
[m, n] = size(uvY);
XYZ = zeros(m, n);
for i = 1:n
    XYZ(1, i) = (9 / 4) * uvY(3, i) * uvY(1, i) / uvY(2, i);
    XYZ(2, i) = uvY(3, i);
    denom = 9 * uvY(3, i) / uvY(2, i);
    XYZ(3, i) = (denom - XYZ(1, i) - 15 * XYZ(2, i)) / 3;
end
