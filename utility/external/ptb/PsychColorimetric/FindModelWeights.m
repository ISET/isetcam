%
% Find the linear model weights for a spectral
% power distribution.
%
% INPUT
%   input - source spectral power distribution
%           (number-of-wavelengths by number-of-lights)
%   B - linear model for spectral power distributions
%           (number-of-wavelengths by n-dimension)
% OUTPUT
%   output - linear model weights
%            (n-dimension by number-of-lights)

% We find the weights by linear regression.
