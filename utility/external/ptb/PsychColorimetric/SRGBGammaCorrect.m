function RGB = SRGBGammaCorrect(rgb, SCALE)
% RGB = SRGBGammaCorrect(rgb,[SCALE])
%
% Gamma correct according to sRGB standard.
%
% SCALE = 0: No scaling applied to input rgb.  Input values > 1 truncated to 1.
% SCALE = 1: Input data scaled to max of 1.  (Default).
%
% Input values less than 0 are truncated to zero.
%
% The gamma correction stage of the SRGB standard converts inputs in the
% range [0,1] into gamma corrected output in the same range.
%
% This routine then multiplies the [0,1] output by 255 and quantizes
% to integer values.  None-the-less, it still returns the output as
% a double (rather than uint8) matrix.  I (DHB) am not sure this was
% a good design decision, but am for now (6/15/11) leaving it as is
% to avoid breaking code that relies on the current implementation.
% [Smarter, I think would have been to return values in the [0,1] range
% and leave the quantization to the caller, or else to convert to uint8
% after scaling into [0,255].]
%
% See XYZToSRGBPrimary for comment on evolution of the standard
% and of this implementation.
