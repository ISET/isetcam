% Convert XYZ (10 degree) to OSA Ljg coordinates.  Formulae
% derived from MacAdam (1974, JOSA, 64, pp. 1691-1702).  Note that
% MacAdam's formulae are in error for the case Y0 less than 30.  The
% correct formulae may be deduced by examing Semelroth's (JOSA, 1970, 16,
% 1685-1689) Eqn. 3, from which MacAdam's incomplete Eqn. 1 is derived.
%
% Note that the above problem is propogated into the formulae
% reported in Wyszecki and Stiles, 2cd edition.  In addition, W+S
% reverse the formulae for G and J and leave out the final
% transformation from scriptL to L.
%
% Finally the formualae published in Brainard (2003, Color appearance and
% color difference specification. In The Science of Color, 2cd edition,
% S. K. Shevell (ed.), Optical Society of America, Washington D.C., 191-216),
% which correct for the above errors, introduce a new mistake: The coefficient
% on B^1/3 for the j coordinate in Eq. 5-2 should be -9.7, rather than the
% the +9.7 that is published.
%
% The output of this routine was verified against the tabulated
% values in W+S, Table I(6.6.4).  These are republished from
% MacAdam (1978, JOSA, 68, 121-130).  See OSAUCSTest.
