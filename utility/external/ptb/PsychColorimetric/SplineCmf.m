% Convert the wavelength representation of a color matching functions/
% spectral sensitivities.
%
% Handling of out of range values:
%   extend == 0: Cubic spline, extends with zeros [default]
%   extend == 1: Cubic spline, extends with last value in that direction
%   extend == 2: Linear interpolation, linear extrapolation
%
% T_in may have multiple rows, in which case T_out does as well.
%
% wls_in and wls_out may be specified as a column vector of
% wavelengths or as a [start delta num] description.
%
% 7/26/03 dhb  Add extend argument and pass to SplineRaw.
% 8/22/05 pbg  Changed T_out to include the extend variable (previously was
%              hardwired to "1".
% 8/13/11 dhb  Update comment to reflect changes in SplineRaw.
