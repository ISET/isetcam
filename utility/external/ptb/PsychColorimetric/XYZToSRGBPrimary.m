function [rgb,M] = XYZToSRGBPrimary(XYZ)
% [rgb,M] = XYZToSRGBPrimary(XYZ)
%
% Convert between CIE XYZ to sRGB primary
% coordinates.  These are linear device
% coordinates for the primaries of the sRGB
% standard.  If your input is scaled in the
% gamut of the monitor, the numbers will come
% out in the range 0-1.  You may want to scale
% the result into the range 0-1 before applying
% sRGB gamma correction.

% The official standard is available at:

% I can't find the official technical standard on the web, but
% there is pretty good agreement across web sources.  Wikipedia
% seems fine, as does.

% Define the transformation matrix.  Now matching what's at w3.org.  The
