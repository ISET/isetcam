function XYZ = SRGBPrimaryToXYZ(rgb)
% XYZ = SRGBPrimaryToXYZ(rgb)
%
% Convert between sRGB primaries and CIE XYZ.
% The rgb are linear device coordinates for the primaries of the sRGB
% standard.  One would expect these to be in the range 0-1, although
% any scaling will simply propogate through to the XYZ coordinates.
