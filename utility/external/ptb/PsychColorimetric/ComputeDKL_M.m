% Set M_raw as in equation A.4.9.
% This is found by plugging the background
% values into equation A.4.8.  Different
% backgrounds produce different matrices.
% The Matlab notation below just
% fills the desired 3-by-3 matrix.
%
% Note that A.4.8 in the Brainard chapter contains
% a typo: the row 1 col 3 entry of the matrix should
% be 0, not 1.  Also, at the top of page 571, there is
% an erroneous negative sign in front of the term
% for W_S-Lum,S.
%
% Finally, A.4.8 as given in the chatper assumes
% that Lum = L + M.  The formula below generalizes
% to arbitrary scaling.
M_raw = [LMLumWeights(1), LMLumWeights(2), 0; ...
    1, -bg(1) / bg(2), 0; ...

% constants by plugging the unit isolating stimuli

% so that we get unit response.  This means
% multiplying each row of M_raw by a constant.
% The easiest way to accomplish the multiplication
% is to form a diagonal matrix with the desired
% scalars on the diagonal.  These scalars are just
% the multiplicative inverses of the non-zero
% entries of the vectors obtained in the previous
% step.  The resulting matrix M provides the
% entries of A.4.11.  The three _resp vectors
% computed should be the three unit vectors
% (and they are).
