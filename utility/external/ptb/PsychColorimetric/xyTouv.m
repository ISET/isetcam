% Convert CIE xy chromaticity to CIE u'v' chromaticity.
%
% These are u',v' chromaticity coordinates in notation
% used by CIE.  See CIE Colorimetry 2004 publication, or Wyszecki
% and Stiles, 2cd, page 165.
%
% Note that there is an obsolete u,v chromaticity diagram that is similar
% but uses 6 in the numerator for v rather than the 9 that is used for v'.
% See CIE Colorimetry 2004, Appendix A, or Judd and Wyszecki, p. 296. If
% you want this (maybe to compute correlated color temperatures), you can
% pass this as 1.  It is 0 by default.
