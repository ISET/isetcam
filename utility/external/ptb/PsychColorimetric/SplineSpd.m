% Convert the wavelength representation of a spectral power distribution.
% Takes change of deltaLambda into account to keep matrix computations
% consistent across wavelength samplings.
%
% Handling of out of range values:
%   extend == 0: Cubic spline, extends with zeros [default]
%   extend == 1: Cubic spline, extends with last value in that direction
%   extend == 2: Linear interpolation, linear extrapolation
%
% spd_in may have multiple columns, in which case spd_out does as well.
%
% wls_in and wls_out may be specified as a column vector of
% wavelengths or as a [start delta n] description.
%
% If wls_out is passed as a vector of wavelengths with just one sample, we don't
% know what the wavelength sampling is, and we can't do the conversion of
% power per wavelength band.  This condition is checked for and an error is
% thrown.  The fix is to pass the wavelengths as an S vector
%   S = [theWavelength wavelengthBandWidth 1].
% This forces an explicit value for the wavelength band width.
%
% 5/6/98  dhb  Change normalization method so that sum is constant.
%              This is a little closer to the desired result for
%              functions with big derivatives.
% 12/7/98 dhb  Remove 5/6/98 change, as it produces the wrong power
%              when you spline across different wavelength regions.
% 7/26/03 dhb  Add extend argument and pass to SplineRaw.
% 8/13/11 dhb  Update comment to reflect changes in SplineRaw.
% 5/10/12 dhb  Small comment fix
% 1/15/18 dhb  Can't believe I wrote this more than 20 years ago!
%         dhb  Put in error check for single wavelength value pass.
