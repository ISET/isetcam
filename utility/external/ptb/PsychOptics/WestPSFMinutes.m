function psf = WestPSFMinutes(radius)
%WESTPSFMINUTES  Compute Westheimer estimate of human PSF
%   psf = WestPSFMinutes(radius)
%
%   Compute Westheimer's PSF function as a function
%   of passed radius.  Radius passed in minutes of arc.
%
%   Formula from Westheimer G. 1986. The eye as an optical instrument.  In
%   Handbook of perception and human performance, KR Boff, L Kaufman,
%   JP Thomas (eds). New York: Wiley.  Equation 7.
%
%   This is only approximately consistent with Westheimer's LSF estimate.
%
%   This comes back normalized to a maximum of 1.
