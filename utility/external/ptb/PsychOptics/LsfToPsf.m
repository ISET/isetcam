function psf = LsfToPsf(lsf, varargin)
%LSFToPSF  Convert a line spread function to a point spread function.
%   psf = LSFTOPSF(lsf,varargin)
%
%   This works by taking the lsf into the one-dimensional frequency domain
%   (i.e. get the 1D MTF) and then creating a circularly symmetric version
%   of this.  The 2D frequency representation is then converted back to the
%   spatial domain to produce the psf.  This produces a spatially-symmetric
%   PSF consistent with the measured line spread function.
%
%   This method is described by Marchand, 1964, JOSA, 54, 7, pp. 915-919
%   and is one of several methods provided.  In 1964, taking the Fourier
%   transform was computationally intense.
%
%   There is a second paper by Marchand (1965, JOSA, 55, 4, 352-354) which
%   treats the more general case where you have line spread functions for
%   many orientations and want to recover an psf that is not necessarily
%   spatially-symmetric.
%
%   The lsf must be spatially symmetric.  This makes sense given that we
%   are going to recover a spatially symmetric psf.
%
%   You want to make sure that the spatial suport is large enough to
%   capture the full lsf.
%
%   The returned psf is normalized to have unit volume.
%
%   See also PSFTOLSF, PSYCHOPTICSTEST

% one from 0 centered to 0 at first entry, and fftshift goes the other way.
