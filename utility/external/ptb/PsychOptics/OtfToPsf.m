function [xGridMinutes, yGridMinutes, psf] = OtfToPsf(xSfGridCyclesDeg, ySfGridCyclesDeg, otf, varargin)
%OTFTOPSF  Convert a 2D optical transfer fucntion to a 2D point spread function.
%    [xSfGridCyclesDeg,ySfGridCyclesDeg,otf] = PsfToOtf([xGridMinutes,yGridMinutes],psf)
%
%    Converts a optical transfer function specified over two-dimensional
%    spatial frequency in cycles per degree to a point spread function
%    specified over positions in minutes.  For human vision, these are each
%    natural units.
%
%    The input spatial frequencies should be specified in matlab's grid
%    matrix format and sf for x and y should be specified over the same
%    spatialfrequency extent and with the same number of evenly spaced
%    samples. Spatial frequency (0,0) should be at location floor(n/2)+1 in
%    each dimension.  The PSF is returned with position (0,0) at location
%    floor(n/2)+1 in each dimension.  This is the form we mostly want to
%    look at and use.
%
%    The OTF is assummed to have the DC term in the center poistion,
%    floor(n/2)+1 of the passed matrix.  If you have your hands on an OTF
%    with the DC term in the upper left position (1,1), apply fftshift to
%    it before passing to this routine.  The DC in upper left is the Matlab
%    native format for applying the ifft, and is also the format stored by
%    isetbio in its optics structure.
%
%    Positions are returned using the same conventions.
%
%    No normalization is performed.  The psf should be real, and we
%    complain (throw an error) if it is not, to reasonable numerial
%    precision. If it seems OK, we make sure it is real.
%
%    We also make sure that the returned psf is all postive and sums to
%    1.  In some cases, we found that there were small negative values
%    and after setting these to zero renormalization was needed.
%
%    We wrote this rather than simply relying on Matlab otf2psf/psf2otf
%    because we want a routine that deals with the conversion of spatial
%    frequency to spatial support.
%
%    If you pass the both sf args as empty, both position grids are
%    returned as empty and just the conversion on the OTF is performed.
%
%    PsychOpticsTest shows that this works very well when we go back and
%    forth for diffraction limited OTF/PSF.  But not exactly exactly
%    perfectly.  A signal processing maven might be able to track down
%    whether this is just a numerical thing or whether some is some small
%    error, for example in how position is converted to sf or back again in
%    the PsfToOtf.
