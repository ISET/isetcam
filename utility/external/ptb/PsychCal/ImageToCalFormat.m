% Take an nX (col dimension) by nY (row dimension) by k image
% and convert it to a format that may be used to Psychtoolbox
% calibration routines.
%
% Note that the order nX,nY makes sense for thinking about images
% in terms of x and y coordinates, but that the order is backwards
% from the MATLAB convention of row dim then column dim.
