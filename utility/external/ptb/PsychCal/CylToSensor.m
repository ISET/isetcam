function sensor = CylToSensor(cyl)
% sensor = CylToSensor(cyl)
%
% Convert from cylindrical to sensor coordinates.
% We use the conventions of the CIE Lxx color spaces
% for angle.  This inverts SensorToCyl, see that routine
% for description of coordinate systems.

% See also SensorToCyl, SensorToPolar, PolarToSensor.
