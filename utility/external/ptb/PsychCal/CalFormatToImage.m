function image = CalFormatToImage(calFormat, nX, nY)
% image = CalFormatToImage(calFormat,nX,nY)
%
% Convert a calibration format image back to a real
% image.
%
% Note that the order nX,nY makes sense for thinking about images
% in terms of x and y coordinates, but that the order is backwards
% from the MATLAB convention of row dim then column dim.
