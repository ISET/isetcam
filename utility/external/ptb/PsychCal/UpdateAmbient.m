% Update the ambient light used in the conversions.  The
% value of P_ambient in the structure is replaced with the
% passed value and the computed quantities that depend on
% it are updated.
%
% The ambient must be specified in the same measurement units as it
% was in the cal at the initial call to SetColorSpace.  If different
% units are desired, all ambient fields in the structure must be updated
% and SetColorSpace called again.  I have never wanted to do this,
% so I haven't written a separate routine.
%
% It is sometimes useful, however, to update the ambient in the
% linear color space defined by the call to SetColorSpace.  To
% do this, use UpdateAmbientLinear.
%
% If flag ADD is true, passed ambient is added to current
% value.  Otherwise passed value replaces current value.
% ADD is false if not passed.  Use caution when setting ADD
% true -- if the ambient is changing during the experiment
% you typically don't want to keep adding multiple times.

% 11/17/93  dhb		Wrote it.
% 8/4/96    dhb   Updated for modern scheme.
% 8/21/97   dhb   Update for structures.
% 3/2/98		dhb		Fix bug in checks introduce 8/21/97, pointed out by dgp.
% 3/10/98		dhb		Change T_ to P_.
% 10/26/99  dhb, mdr  Fix bug in checks. There was also a variable name
%									glitch.  I don't think this could have worked the way
%									it was.  Perhaps no one calls it.
% 5/2/02    dhb, kr  Add ADD flag.

% Set default on optional argument.
