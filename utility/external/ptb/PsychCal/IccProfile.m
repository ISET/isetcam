% IccProfile.mex will read any ICC or ColorSync profile. The
% International Color Consortium (ICC) published a standard file
% format for saving color calibration data for imaging devices. This
% includes digital cameras, scanners, printers, and monitors. Users
% of the Psychophysics Toolbox will be primarily interested in the
% use of an ICC Profile to characterize their CRT monitor or LCD
% display. The idea is that the file contains all the necessary
% information to transform the specification of a color in a standard
% perceptual space (e.g. CIE X,Y,Z) into the numbers necessary to
% display that color.

%
% USAGE:
%
% icc=IccProfile('Read',file)                      % Gets data into Matlab.
% folder=IccProfile('Folder')                      % ColorSync Profiles folder
% file=IccProfile('Filename',screenNumber,newfile) % Get/set screen's profile.
% IccProfile('ShortDump',file,[tag])               % For exploring.
% IccProfile('Dump',file,[tag])                    % ""
% IccProfile('LongDump',file,[tag])                % ""
%
% "file"      is a filename, a partial or complete path, for an ICC
%             Profile file. The default folder is the ColorSync Profiles
%             folder (in the System Folder).
% "icc"       is a Matlab struct.
% "folder"    path string gives location of ColorSync Profiles folder.
% "tag"       is a four-character string identifying a chunk of
%             information in the icc profile, e.g. 'rTRC' for the red
%             Tone Reproduction Curve (i.e. gamma curve for red phosphor)
%             or 'gXYZ' for the the X,Y,Z color coordinates of the green
%             phosphor.
% 'Read'      returns a Matlab struct with one field for each tag in the
%             profile. The field will still be present, but empty, if the
%             tag is of an unknown type, or if an error was encountered in
%             reading the tag. (Use 'Dump' to diagnose.) 'Read' recognizes
%             most of the tag types relevant to monitor calibration.
% 'Folder'    returns the path (a string) for the ColorSync Profiles folder.
%             Use DIR(IccProfile('Folder')) to get a list of files there.
% 'Filename'  get and/or set the filename of the profile associated with your
% 						screen. Or use the Monitors control panel (go to color) to choose.
%             Note that setting the file has the side effect of loading
%             the video card's gamma table from the 'vcgt', if present in
%             your profile.
% 'Dump'      describes every tag in the profile. Or just one tag.
% 'ShortDump' describes every tag in the profile, with less detail.
% 'LongDump'  describes every tag in the profile, with more detail.
%
% EXAMPLE:
%
% file=iccprofile('filename',0)
% icc=iccprofile('read',file)
%
% This will read all the information in the profile associated with
% screen 0 (the main screen) and provide it to you as a handy Matlab struct
% "icc" that you can use in your software. For explanation of the contents,
% consult the official ICC documentation, plus Apple's documentation of
% their custom tags: 'vcgt' and 'mmod'.

%
% EXPLANATION OF TAG TYPE:
%
% Most of the information in a profile is stored as chunks of data,
% called elements. Each element has a unique 4-character tag name and
% a 4-character tag type. IccProfile accepts every tag name, and
% installs a corresponding field in your icc struct, with the same
% name (e.g. 'desc'). However, IccProfile will be able to transfer the
% content of the profile element to your struct only if IccProfile
% recognizes the type. At present, IccProfile can read the following
% tag types:
%
% NAME                        TYPE      TAGS THAT USE IT.
% Profile description         'desc'    'desc'
% Tone reproduction curve     'curv'    'rTRC','gTRC','bTRC','kTRC'
% X,Y,Z of a color            'XYZ '    'rXYZ','gXYX','bXYZ','wtpt','bkpt','lumi'
% Text string                 'text'    'cprt'
% Date and time               'dtim'    'calt'
% Viewing conditions          'view'    'view'
% Measurement type            'meas'    'meas'
% Data (unformatted)          'data'
% Unsigned 8-bit int array    'ui08'
% Unsigned 16-bit int array   'ui16'
% Unsigned 32-bit int array   'ui32'
% Unsigned 64-bit int array   'ui64'
% Unsigned 32-bit fixed array 'uf32'
% Signed 32-bit fixed array   'sf32'
% Video card gamma            'vcgt'    'vcgt'
% Make and model              'mmod'    'mmod'

%
% NOTE: IccProfile may report errors in an apparently good profile.
% This is because icclib enforces the ICC standard more strictly than
% ColorSync does, so it picks up errors that were previously missed.
% (On 7/31/00 we reported to Apple two such errors, affecting most of their
% ColorSync Profiles, and added a work-around to IccProfile.)
% You can try running Apple's "Profile First Aid", which detects and
% fixs some common profile errors, though it too is less strict than
% icclib. "Profile First Aid" 3.0.1 is installed in the Apple
% Extras:ColorSync Extras folder when you install ColorSync 3.0.1

%
% CALIBRATION:
%
% You can buy a calibration package consisting of a program (e.g.
% ColorBlind ProveIt! or Monaco EZColor) and a simple colorimeter to
% easily create an ICC profile for your monitor. Using IccProfile.mex,
% it should be easy to use that calibration data to do your color
% corrections, but we haven't actually tried that yet. Here are a few
% calibrators that seems to be good, from what we've read. We've
% included links to the manufacturer (if available) and to Jon Cone's
% inkjetmall web site because he knows a lot about digital
% printing and has good advice about choosing among these products.
%
% ColorBlind ProveIt! software $50
% Does not include colorimeter. Can be used alone, using perceptual
% matching, or with the Sequel Chroma 4 colorimeter, below.
% web http://www.color.com/Products/proveit.html ;
% web http://www.inkjetmall.com/store/prove-it.html ;
%
% Sequel Chroma 4 CRT & LCD monitor colorimeter $249
% Requires software, which is not included. Compatible with ColorBlind
% and Monaco.
% web http://www.inkjetmall.com/store/measuring-devices.html#monitors ;
%
% Monaco EZColor software $299
% MonacoSENSOR colorimeter $249 (or both together for $499)
% web https://www.xrite.com/ ;
%
% The ColorBlind+Sequel package, for $299, is cheaper than the $499
% Monaco package, and the ColorBlind software seems to be at least as
% highly regarded as Monaco's by Jon Cone and others using it to
% calibrate their monitors for critical digital color printing.

% ACKNOWLEDGEMENT: IccProfile.mex is largely a Matlab interface to
% the excellent free icclib created in C by Graeme Gill, for which we
% are very grateful.
