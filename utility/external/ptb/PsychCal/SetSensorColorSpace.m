% Initialize the sensor color space for use in calibration.  Requires
% a calibration structure which contains the standard
% fields.  These are checked for and a message is printed if
% they are not there.
%
% Checks that wavelength sampling is consistent and splines
% if not.
%
% errorRet indicates status of the operation.
%   == 0: OK
%   == 1: Bad condition number on linear/device conversion matrix
%
% quiet flag suppresses error messages, default 0.

% 9/13/93     dhb   Wrote it.
% 10/16/93    jms   Added optional calData arg which is freed if passed.
% 10/30/93    dhb   Added nDevices, nBases arguments.
%             dhb   Removed optional freeing.  It is a little too clever.
% 11/11/93    dhb   Re-wrote entirely in Matlab.  The C version is too clever.
% 11/17/93    dhb   Call back through new, less clever, C routines.
%             dhb   Support to store M_ambient_linear with compute vars
% 8/4/96      dhb   Converted to modern format from original DHB scheme.
% 8/21/97     dhb   Converted for structures.
% 3/10/98	  dhb	Store T_linear and S_linear.  Seems like a good idea.
%		            Remove nBasesIn, which is never used.
% 					Change nBasesOut to nPrimaryBases.
% 1/4/00      mpr   Added quiet flag to suppress display of messages I don't care about.
% 2/25/99     dhb   Fix case of SplineCmf.
% 4/5/02      dhb, ly  New calling convention.  Internal naming not updated.
% 4/23/04     dhb   Make quiet the default.
% 3/18/10     dhb   Store T_sensor, S_sensor in fields cal.T_sensor, cal.S_sensor.
%                   These are redundant with old cal.T_linear, cal.S_linear, but
%                   it's possible that deleting those will break something in
%                   some calling program.  So I'm leaving both in for the next
%                   few years.
% 4/14/15  dhb      Handle case where S_device and/or S_ambient are not
%                   passed, or are passed empty.  This has to do with
%                   maintaining forward compatibility with BrainardLab
