%
% Fit a gamma function.  This essentially a driver function.
% It has two main purposes.
%
% First it tries several different
% underlying parametric forms for the fit and chooses the best
% for a particular data set.
%
% Second, it does the bookkeeping for fitting each column of
% input measurements.  (Each of the underlying fit functions expects
% only vector input.)
%
% To a large extent, the interface to the underlying fit functions
% (e.g. FitGammaPow, FitGammaSig, ...) is uniform.  However, this routine
% does have to know a little bit about initial value dimension and choice.
% We have tried to localize this information in the initialization routines
% (e.g. InitialXPow, InitialXSig, ...) as much as possible, but some
% caution is advised.
%
% Optional argument fitType allows you to force the return of a particular
% paramtetric form.  Currently:
%   fitType == 1:  Power function
%   fitType == 2:  Extended power function
%   fitType == 3:  Sigmoid
%   fitType == 4:  Weibull
%   fitType == 5:  Modified polynomial
%   fitType == 6:  Linear interpolation
%   fitType == 7:  Cubic spline
%
% All fit types are in a form such that the fit is forced through the
% origin for 0 input.  This is because our convention is that gamma
% correction happens after subtraction of the ambient light.
%
% NOTE: FitGammaPow (and perhaps other subroutines) uses CONSTR, which is part of the
% Mathworks Optimization Toolbox.
%
% Also see FitGammaDemo.

% 10/3/93   dhb		Removed polynomial fit from list tried with fitType == 0.
% 					Added Weibull function fit
% 3/15/94   dhb, jms Added linear interpolation.
% 7/18/94   dhb		Added cubic spline interpolation.
% 8/7/00    dhb     Fix bug.  Spline was calling linear interpolation.  Thanks to
%                   Chien-Chung Chen for notifying us of this bug.
% 11/14/06  dhb     Modify how default type is set.  Handle passed empty matrix.
% 3/07/10   dhb     Cosmetic to make m-lint happier, including some "|" -> "||"
% 5/26/10   dhb     Allow values_in to be either a single column or a matrix with same number of columns as values_out.
% 6/5/10    dhb     Fix a lot of MATLAB lint warnings.
%           dhb     Fix error reporting to actually take mean across devices.
%           dhb     Rewrite how mean is taken for evaluation of best fit. I think this was done right.
% 11/07/10  dhb     Print out fit exponents when gamma fit by a simple power function.
