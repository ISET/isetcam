function output = MakeGammaMonotonic(input)
% output = MakeGammaMonotonic(input)
%
% Make input monotonically increasing from lowest value.
%
% This version also forces the last value to be 1, and then
% enforces decreasing downwards from there, after the
% enforcement of increasing from 0.
%
% 3/1/99  dhb  Handle multiple columns.
% 8/03/07 dhb  Old routine just enforced non-decreasing.  Fixed to make strictly increasing.
% 3/07/10 dhb  Wrote from MakeMonotonic.
%              Did not want to change behavior of MakeMonotonic in case it is called from
%              programs unrelated to gamma fitting.
% 3/08/10 dhb  Actually do the enforcement of 1.
% 5/27/10 dhb  Use a larger bump, 100*eps
