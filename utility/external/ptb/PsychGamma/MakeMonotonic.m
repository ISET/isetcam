%
% Make input monotonically increasing.
%
% See also MakeGammaMonotonic, which is probably what you want if you are fitting
% gamma functions.  This routine left alone when MakeGammaMonotonic was created,
% in case it is called from programs completely unrelated to gamma fitting.
%
% 3/1/99  dhb  Handle multiple columns.
% 8/03/07 dhb  Old routine just enforced non-decreasing.  Fixed to make strictly increasing.
% 3/07/10 dhb  Added comment about MakeGammaMonotonic.
