% Compute a root fractional SSE between data and prediction.
% Inputs should be column vectors.

% The routine badly named, because what it computes
% is not what anyone would call an RMSE.  A better
% name for the routine would be ComptueFSSE or something
% like that.
%
% Indeed, it now calls through an appropriately named
% ComputeFSSE, and issues an annoying warning encouraging
% the user to change the calling form.
%
% 2/3/96   dhb  Added improved comments.
% 1/13/13  dhb  Added cautionary comment about what this routine does.
%               as well as message that would tell an unsuspecting user
%               at runtime.
%          dhb  Added mechanism to suppress the warning message.

% Warning about misnomer of routine.
