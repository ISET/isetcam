% Compute the weighted aphakic (photochemical) radiance for Type 1 instruments as given on page 8, Table 2,
% 5.4.1.3.b.
%
% Input spectrum is radiance in units of Watts/[sr-m2-wlinterval].
%
% Also return the exposure limit for this quantity.
%
% See page 6 for a definition of a Type 1 instrument.  As far as I can tell, the key
% criterion is that it doesn't put out more light that exceeds the Type 1 limits.
%
% If the exposure time is longer than 2 hours the specified limits should be reduced by
% 1/exposureDuration in hours.  This routine implements that adjustment for its returned
% limit value.  It does not implement a further reduction of of the limit (by a factor of 2)
% specifed for microscopes and endoilluminators.
%
% The standard specifies that the passed radiance should be the highest averaged over
% an aperture of a specified size, where the size depends on the instrument.  This
% routine does not worry about that aspect.  The most conservative thing to do is
% to pass the highest localized power that will be presented.
%
% The indicates that radiance should be measured through a 7 mm aperture at the cornea.
% I believe this refers to the case where you are measuring radiance by measuring radiant
% flux through two apertures at a known distance apart.  It would then make sense that you'd
% want to know the radiance defined by the direction subtended by a 7 mm aperture at the
% cornea, e.g. right where a large pupil would be.  If you measure using some other device
% (e.g. a PhotoResearch PR-XXX that directly obtains radiance and do so from the eye position,
% that also seems reasonable.
