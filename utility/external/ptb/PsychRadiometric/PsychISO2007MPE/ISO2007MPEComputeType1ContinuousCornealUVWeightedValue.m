% Compute the weighted UV radiation for Type 1 instruments as given on page 7, Table 2
% 5.4.1.1.
%
% Input spectrum is radiance in units of Watts/[sr-m2-wlinterval].
%
% Also return the exposure limit for this quantity.
%
% See page 6 for a definition of a Type 1 instrument.  As far as I can tell, the key
% criterion is that it doesn't put out more light that exceeds the Type 1 limits.
%
% If the exposure time is longer than 2 hours the specified limits should be reduced by
% 1/exposureDuration in hours.  This routine implements that adjustment for its returned
% limit value.  It does not implement a further reduction of of the limit (by a factor of 2)
% for microscopes and endoilluminators.
