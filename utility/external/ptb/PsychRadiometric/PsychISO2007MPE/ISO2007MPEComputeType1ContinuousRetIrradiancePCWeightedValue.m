% Compute the weighted aphakic (photochemical) retinal irradiance for Type 1 instruments as given on page 8, Table 2,
% 5.4.1.3.a.
%
% Input spectrum is radiance in units of Watts/[sr-m2-wlinterval].
%
% Also return the exposure limit for this quantity.
%
% See page 6 for a definition of a Type 1 instrument.  As far as I can tell, the key
% criterion is that it doesn't put out more light that exceeds the Type 1 limits.
%
% If the exposure time is longer than 2 hours the specified limits should be reduced by
% 1/exposureDuration in hours.  This routine implements that adjustment for its returned
% limit value.  It does not implement a further reduction of of the limit (by a factor of 2)
% specifed for microscopes and endoilluminators.
%
% The standard specifies that the passed radiance should be the highest averaged over
% an aperture of a specified size, where the size depends on the instrument.  This
% routine does not worry about that aspect.  The most conservative thing to do is
% to pass the highest localized power that will be presented.
%
% The standard specifies a pupil diameter (7 mm) to use for the conversion from radiance
% to retinal irradiance, but not an eye length.  We use 17 mm here by default.  You
% can override this by passing a different length in mm.
