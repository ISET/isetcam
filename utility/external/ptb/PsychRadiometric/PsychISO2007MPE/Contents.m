% Partial and in progress implementation of ISO 2007 standard for computing
% maximum permissable exposure to broadband lights.
%
% *****************************************************************
%
% IMPORTANT
%
%   Individuals using these routines must accept full responsibility
%   for light exposures they implement. We recommend that values computed
%   with these routines be carefully checked against independent calculations.
%   We have done our best to follow the standard, but it is very complex and
%   there may be errors.
%
% *****************************************************************
%
% NOTES:
%
%   a) As of June, 2013, these routines are still very much a work
%   in progress and should thus be treated with special caution.  See
%   ISO2007MPEBasicTest.  If someone has some worked out test cases
%   it would be great to check those against the computations done
%   by this suite of routines.  Please contact me (brainard@psych.upenn.edu)
%   if you can help.
%
%   b) Only the Type 1 limits are computed.  My impression is that these are
%   more conservative, and that if you stay below them you good wrt the
%   standard content.  I believe that technically, a Type 1 instrument is
%   one that *cannot* produce more light than the Type 1 limits, but it seems
%   to me that for research purposes the main point is to stay below those limits
%   independent of what the instrument could in principle produce.
%
%   In addition, for exposure durations of less than 2 hours (7200) seconds, the
%   Type 2 limits are more lenient than the Type 1 limits, except for 5.5.1.5b versus
%   5.4.1.6b, where the worst case Type 2 limit is a little lower (5.88 W/[sr-cm2]
%   than the Type 1 limit (6 W/[sr-cm2]).  To be conservative, I used the 5.88 value
%   in the relevant routine.
%
%   If someone knows more or has a different view, please let me (DHB, brainard@psych.upenn.edu) know.
%
%   c) There is a limit (Table 2, 5.4.1.5) for convergent beams, which I think is what
%   a Maxwellian view produces.  I wrote a placeholder routine for this limit, but since
%   I am not currently using such a rig I don't have any application for it and have
%   not tested it.
%
%   d) The standard uses cm^2 based units for radiance, irradiance, etc.  It switches
%   between uWatts, mWatts, and Watts depending on which limit is being considered.
%   For uniformity, these routines return all quantities and limits in uWatts, cm^2
%   based units.
%
%   For input, we typically measure radiance in Watts/[sr-m^22] and all the routines take
%   radiance as input and convert as necessary (with the help of passed ancilliary arguments).
%   To match the measurement instrumentation we use, the radiance units are kept in
%   units of Watts/[sr-m^22], and the routines do the appropriate converstions.
%   these are the input units expected. The one exception on the input is the convergent beam limit,
%   where the input is irradiance and should be passed in uWatts/cm^2.   The help text is pretty
%   clear about what is desired for each routine.
%
%   e) For computations of retinal illumiance, these routines used a default eye length of 17 mm.
%   This does not seem to be specified in the standard, but is the number given in the Landry et.
%   al (2011) paper.
