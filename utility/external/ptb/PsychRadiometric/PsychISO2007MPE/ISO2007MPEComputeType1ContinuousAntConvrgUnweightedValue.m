% Compute the unweighted radiation for anterior segment convergent beam value, for Type 1 instruments as given on page 8, Table 2,
% 5.4.1.5.  This limit applies only to convergent beams, whatever they are.  I'm guessing this is what a Maxwellian view produces,
% however, as in that case the beam is brought to a waist inside the eye.  In this case, the limit applies to the irradiance
% at the beam waist over the 1 mm diameter aperture with the highest irradiance.
%
% Unlike all the other routines in this suite, the key quantity is probably not best passed as stimulus radiance.  Rather, for
% this type of optical system, the relevant irradiance should be measured directly.
%
% NOTE: This routine has not been tested, since I (DHB) don't have any instrument currently that produces the relevant type of
% stimulus.  I added it as a placeholder for convenience.  There is an error statement to keep it from being used
% until it is tested.
%
% Input spectrum is radiance in units of UWatts/[m2-wlinterval].
%
% Also return the exposure limit for this quantity.
%
% See page 6 for a definition of a Type 1 instrument.  As far as I can tell, the key
% criterion is that it doesn't put out more light that exceeds the Type 1 limits.
%
% If the exposure time is longer than 2 hours the specified limits should be reduced by
% 1/exposureDuration in hours.  This routine implements that adjustment for its returned
% limit value.  It does not implement a further reduction of of the limit (by a factor of 2)
% for microscopes and endoilluminators.
