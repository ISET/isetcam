% Tests radiometric calculations and light safety calculations.
%
% Reads in tab delimted text file AnsiZ136MPEDeloriTestInput.txt that has a set of
% rows in it.  Each row provides stimulus properties for a monochromtic
% light and values obtained from Delori's spreadsheet.
% (There are also some other test values entered by hand in the text file, for
% other radiometric quanties that I could not find computed in Delori's spreadsheet.)
%
% Delori's spreadsheet is described in footnote 49 of Delori et al. (2007,
% JOSA A, 24, pp.1250-1265).  That footnote indicates that the spreadsheet
% will be shared as long as recipients accept full responsibility for its use.
% The version of Delori's spreadsheet used to get these numbers is 0cLC_0.9.9.

% As of 5/1/13 (Notes from DHB):
%   I am unable to get complete agreement between Delori's calculations and
%   the PTB calculations.  But I get agreement for some wavelength, stimulus
%   size, and stimulus duration choices.  To get agreement, this routine
%   uses the effective pupil size formula from the Delori et al. 2007 paper
%   when converting the limit to power in the pupil.
%
%   A key question in going from the number in the 2007 standard and retinal
%   illuminant is what pupil size was assumed in the standard.  Delori et al.
%   (2007) give a formula for this, which (I think) goes from the radiant
%   power in light at the cornea overfilling the pupil to the pupil size.
%   See Eq. 8.  That is implemented in this test program.
%
%   To get the degree of agreement I obtained, I also had to turn off
%   the limiting cone aperture calculation that is described in Table 2 of the
%   2007 standard.  This is controlled by a flag in the input file.
%
%   Conversions to retinal illuminance done wtth the pupil diameter and
%   eye length specified in the input file.  Delori et al. (2007) indicate
%   that the standard assumes an eye length of 17 mm.  The calculation uses
%   this to compute the allowable retinal illuminance, but if you think some
%   other length is better, you can fill it in.
%
%   In the cases where I don't get agreement with the spreadsheet, the discrepancy
%   arises in the value used for constant T2.  Delori's spreadsheet seems to use
%   10000 for a 2 degree stimulus, but as I read the standard (Table 6, p. 76), this
%   value has a maximum of 100 and a smaller value (21.83) for T2.  This matters when
%   the thermal limit is controlling, for some stimulus durations.  Currently this
%   happens for test conditions 3 and 6.  The code here
%   reproduces what I get when I do the computations by hand.  See files in this
%   directory
%     MPEByHand_580_2deg_100sec.doc
%     MPEByHand_700_2deg_20000sec.doc
%   I have emailed Delori (on 5/2/13) to ask him about this.  And also about the
%   limiting cone aperature calculation mentioned above.

% 2/27/13  dhb  Wrote it.

%% See if we can match some conversions computed
% by Ed Pugh and conveyed to me by Brian Wandell.
%
% Ed starts with retinal illuminance of 10^15 in quanta/[cm2-sec]'
%   He gets 340 uW/cm2.  We get 342.
%   He gets ~590,000 trolands.  We get about this assuming 17 mm eye length.
%   He gets ~190,000 cd/m2 for a 2mm diameter pupil.  We also get about this.

%% Check ANSI light limit calculations against numbers in Eds document.  He doesn't say
% the durations or size he assumed, but he does say he got the numbers from Delori's
% spreadsheet.  Let's try making up a source size and duration and see what happens.


% When I plug these numbers (580 nm, 2 degree stimulus, 2 mm pupil diameter, 1 second exposure)
% into the version of Delori's spreadsheet I got via Ed Pugh (rev 1/10/08), it computes that
% the stimulus has:
%   a retinal irradiance of 340 uW/cm2
%   a radiance of 31.28 mW/[cm2 sr]
%   a corneal irradiance of 29.93 uW/cm2,
%   total radiant energy in the pupil of 940.33 nJ.
%   retinal radiant exposure of 340 uJ/cm2.
% We compute these quantities using PTB routines.  From above we already have the retinal irradiance
% at about 340 Watts/cm2. The rest of the numbers also match up pretty well.  Rounding in the spreadsheet
% plus perhaps a different assumption about eye length can explain the differences, I think.

% The spreadsheet computes the exposure safety limit for this stimulus as:
%  radiant power in the pupil 2.96 mW
%  radiant energy in the pupil of 2.96 mJ
%  retinal irradiance 1.07 W/cm2
%  retinal exposure of 1.07 J/cm2
