%
% The assumption underlying this routine is that the relative spectrum of a light
% is available, as well as the total power of the light passing through an aperture
% of known size.  This is the situation in the apparatus we use in Sterling's lab.
%	The routine computes the irradiance (watts/um^2-wlinterval) from the relative spectrum
% (relative power, not relative quanta) and a measurement of the total power in watts,
% given the radiometer properties specified.
%
% Radiometers do not typically have an ideal flat spectral response, and the actual
% spectral response is often provided as part of the instrument calibration.  In addition,
% the instruments are typically calibrated to provide an accurate reading for one
% particular reference spectrum, which is also specified.  This routine is set up
% to use this calibration information together with the known relative spectrum to
% provide a correct result.  The radiometer properties may be passed in the radiometer
% structure.  A default structure is set up that describes the radiometer used in
% the Sterling lab.  This structure also describes the collecting area of the measurement
% configuration.
%
% This routine could be easily modified to deal with a photometric head.
%
% Input variables: relativeSpectrum is the relative power as a function of wavelength.
%                  relativeSpectrumS is the wavelength sampling information for the relativeSpectrum.
%								   readingInWatts is the total power measured.
%                  radiometer is a structure describing the radiometer. (default = Sterling Lab's IL1400A).
