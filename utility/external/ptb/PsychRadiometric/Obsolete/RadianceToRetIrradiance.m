function irradianceWattsPerUm2 = RadianceToRetIrradiance(radianceWattsPerM2Sr, radianceS, pupilAreaMm2, eyeLengthMm)
% irradianceWattsPerUm2 = RadianceToRetIrradiance(radianceWattsPerM2Sr,radianceS,pupilAreaMm2,eyeLengthMm)
%
% Perform the geometric calculations necessary to convert a measurement of source
% radiance to corresponding retinal irradiance.
%
%   Input radianceWattsPerM2Sr should be in units of power/m^2-sr-wlinterval.
%   Input radianceS gives the wavelength sampling information.
%   Input pupilAreaMm2 should be in units of mm^2.
%   Input eyeLengthMm should be the length of the eye in mm.
%   Output irradianceWattsPerUm2 is in units of power/um^2-wlinterval.
%
%   Light power may be expressed in watts or quanta-sec or in your
%   favorite units.  Indeed, it may also be passed as energy rather
%   than power.
%
% This conversion does not take absorption in the eye into account,
% as this is more conveniently foldeded into the spectral absorptance.
%
% See also: RadianceAndPupilAreaEyeLengthToRetIrradiance, radPupilAreaFromLum, EyeLength, RetIrradianceToRadiance.
%
% Note: This routine is now obsolete, as it mixes radiometric and unit conversions.  Preferred is to
% use RadianceAndPupilAreaEyeLengthToRetIrradiance and then take charge of your units in your
% calling code.
%
% 7/10/03  dhb  Wrote it.
% 11/06/03 dhb  Fixed comments about units, as per Lu Yin email.
% 3/29/12  dhb  Comment on output units was wrong.  It said power/um^2-sec-wlinterval
%               but the 'sec' part makes no sense given the 'power' in the numerator.
% 2/28/13  dhb  Make units clear in variable names.
% 3/6/13   dhb  Rewrite to use new conversion function.  Move to Obsolete directory.
%          dhb  Also improved variable naming.
