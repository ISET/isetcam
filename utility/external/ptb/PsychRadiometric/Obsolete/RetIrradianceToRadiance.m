%
% Perform the geometric calculations necessary to convert a measurement of retinal
% irradiance to the source radiance that would produce it.
%
%   Input irradianceWattsPerUm2 is in units of power/um^2-wlinterval.
%   Input irradianceS gives the wavelength sampling information.
%   Input pupilAreaMm2 should be in units of mm^2.
%   Input eyeLengthMm should be the length of the eye in mm.
%   Output radianceWattsPerM2Sr is in units of power/m^2-sr-wlinterval.
%
%   Light power may be expressed in watts or quanta-sec or in your
%   favorite units.  Indeed, it may also be passed as energy rather
%   than power.
%
% This conversion does not take absorption in the eye into account,
% as this is more conveniently foldeded into the spectral absorptance.

%
% Note: This routine is now obsolete, as it mixes radiometric and unit conversions.  Preferred is to
% use RadianceAndPupilAreaEyeLengthToRetIrradiance and then take charge of your units in your
% calling code.
%
% 2/28/13  dhb  Wrote it.
% 3/6/13   dhb  Rewrite to use new conversion function.  Move to Obsolete directory.
%          dhb  Also improved variable naming.
