function quanta = EnergyToQuanta(wls, energy)
% quanta = EnergyToQuanta(wls,energy)
%
% Convert energy units (energy or power per unit wavelength)
% to quantal units (quanta or quanta/sec per unit wavelength).
%
% Constants are set up so that we have energy in joules or
% power in watts.  Wavelengths should be passed in nanometers.
%
% The routine is set up to convert spectra.  These are
% passed as the columns of the matrix energy.  The
% wavelengths corresponding to each row are passed in
% the column vector wls.
