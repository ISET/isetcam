%
% Convert retinal irradiance measured in units of Y/x^2 to units of
% Y/deg^2, where x is a unit of distance (m, cm, mm, um, etc.) and
% Y is a measure of light amount (Watts, Joules, quanta/sec, quanta, etc.)
%
% Eye length should be passed in units of x.
%
% The conversion assumes that we are in the small angle regime, where
% degrees are essentially linear with retinal extent.

% Convert x to degrees.  The routine RetinalMMToDegrees does not
% actually care whether the input is in mm, it just needs its
% two arguments to be in the same units.
%
% We use DegreesToRetinalMM and invert it, rather than RetinalMMToDegrees.
% This is because with the former, we can force the number of degrees to be small
% and get a factor valid in the small angle range.  If we do it the
% other way, when the units of distance are large relative to the
% eye length, weird things can happen.
