% Let x be the units of distance (m, cm, mm, um, etc.)
%
%   Input irradiance_PowerPerArea is in units of power/x^2-wlinterval.
%   Input irradianceS gives the wavelength sampling information.
%   Input pupilArea should be in units of x^2.
%   Input eyeLength should be the length of the eye in x.

%
% This conversion does not take absorption in the eye into account,
% as this is more conveniently foldeded into the spectral absorptance.
