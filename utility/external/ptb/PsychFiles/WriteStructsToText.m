% WriteStructsToText(filename,theStructs)
%
% Write a tab delimited text file.  The first row should
% contain the field names for a structure.  Each following
% row contains the data for one instance of that structure.
%
% This routine writes each element of the structure array as a row.
% Only numeric and string field values are supported.
%
% If the filename is a string, this routine handles opening and
% closing of the file.  Otherwise, this routine assumes
% that what was passed is a valid fid and uses it as such,
% leaving the calling routine to do the opening and closing.
%
% 06/16/03 dhb  Wrote it.
% 07/01/03 dhb  Support string fields too.
% 08/12/06 dhb  Call filetype only if OS9.
% 07/07/13 dhb  Add handling of non-string filename as fid.

% Open the file
