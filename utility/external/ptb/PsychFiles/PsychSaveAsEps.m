%
% SaveAsEps converts a grayscale image (in a Matlab matrix) to a
% PostScript file that a LaserWriter or Linotype will accurately render on
% paper. The output file is a standard Encapsulated PostScript File, with
% file type 'EPSF', commonly referred to as an "eps" file. Most word
% processors, e.g. Word and PageMaker, know how to import eps files.
% Macintoshes only understand QuickDraw, not PostScript, so they don't
% know what image the PostScript code would produce. The Macintosh file
% "creator" of the eps file is set to Microsoft Word, so double-clicking
% it will open it as a Word document containg the image.
%
% I suggest you use the $25 shareware Macintosh application EPS Factory
% to add a PICT preview to your file, based on the postscript already
% there. You can download EPS Factory from
% web http://www.artage.com/pages/products/products.html
% (The old freeware ps2eps is incompatible with Mac OS 8.6 and 9, alas.)
% The PICT preview will make the image will look approximately right on
% your monitor, e.g. in Word.
%
% If you want to convert the EPS file to some other format, we recommend
% using Adobe Illustrator, especially the "Export to Web" feature.
%
% To import into Word, use the Insert:Picture or
% Insert:File command. Once imported, you can get Word to rescale the
% image by dragging the image's lower right corner while holding down the
% shift key. Try the VideoToolbox demo Grating. Bear in mind that
% on-screen you're looking at the PICT, whereas, when you print on a
% LaserWriter, the image is produced by the PostScript code. When in your
% word processor, the on-screen images will look best if you use the
% Monitors control panel to set your monitor to 256 Grays, but this won't
% affect printing.
%
% The filename, by convention, should end in '.eps' to indicate that it's
% an encapsulated postscript file, but this is not enforced. The file's
% type is set to 'EPSF' with creator 'R*ch'. (This creator corresponds to
% BBEdit, so double-clicking will open it as a text file in BBEdit, which
% includes a Special:SendPostScript command for downloading poscript
% images to the laserwriter. You can change the creator to be anything you
% want.)
%
% 	The image matrix must have 8 bits per pixel (i.e. values 0 to 255). No
% color tables are used. The raw pixel value (Apple calls it an "index")
% is sent directly to the printer with no transformation. PostScript
% assumes that the number, from 0 to 255 is proportional to desired
% reflectance, from zero to 1.
%  	The pageRect is subtle. It describes, in typographers points (1/72"),
% the rectangle that your image will be mapped onto on the printed page.
% It is essential that you keep in mind that Apple and Adobe use different
% coordinate systems. Both Apple and Adobe increase x from left to right.
% However, Apple has y increasing from top to bottom, whereas Adobe
% increases y from bottom to top. Adobe's origin is the lower left corner
% of the page, even though that point is usually not printable, since most
% printers can only print to within about a half inch of the edge. The
% pageRect, though supplied in Apple's Rect data structure, must be in
% Adobe's coordinates, respecting the names of the Rect structure's
% fields: left, top, right, bottom. So, for an image to fill most of an
% 8.5x11 page, with 0.5" margins, you might use the following:
%
% 		pageRect=SetRect(0.5,10.5,8,0.5)*72;
%
% In printing PostScript halftones the halftone cell size determines both
% the spatial and graylevel resolutions of the resulting image. If the
% "resolution" parameter is positive, then it specifies the cellsPerInch;
% if it's negative then it specifies the number of grayLevels. If
% "resolution" is omitted then the printer will be left at its default
% cell size, which is usually a good choice. Note that there need not be
% any particular correspondence between pixels in your image and cells in
% the halftone; the printer automatically resamples your image to produce
% the halftone.
% 	If you specify cellsPerInch (resolution>0) then the printer will be
% asked to print its halftone with that many halftone cells per inch. E.g.
% to produce a halftone original for subsequent one-to-one reproduction in
% a journal, you'll want the cells to be coarse enough for them to
% reproduce without re-screening, e.g. 100 cells per inch.
% 	Alternatively, if you specify grayLevels (resolution<0) then the printer
% will be asked to print its halftone with cells containing grayLevels-1
% printer pixels, yielding the specified number of gray levels. E.g. you
% might want to force your 300 dpi LaserWriter to use big cells yielding
% 256 gray levels.
%  	If resolution==0 or resolution==[], it will be ignored.
% 	Here's a minimal example that prints an image to disk, preserving the
% size and scale of the image,
%
% 		SaveAsEps('test.eps',m);
%
% The default pageRect is equivalent to this:
%
% 		pageRect=SetRect(0,-0,size(m,2),-size(m,1));% Adobe coordinates
% 		pageRect=CenterRect(pageRect,SetRect(0,11,8.5,0)*72);
% 		SaveAsEps('test.eps',m,pageRect);
%
% Tiling is something we often want to do, creating a huge image by taping
% many pages together. You accomplish this by repeatedly printing the huge
% image--only one pageful appears each time--shifting the image so that
% eventually every bit has been printed. (It's slow, since the whole image
% is transmitted to the printer each time.) Here's an example that creates
% a big "width" by "height" image. We tile onto multiple 8.5"x11" pages,
% using 7.5"x10" of each page, allowing for 0.5" nonprinting margins:
%
% 		delete 'test.eps';
% 		mosaicRect=SetRect(0,height,width,0);	% In units of "points". 72 points/inch.
% 		mosaicRect=OffsetRect(mosaicRect,0.5*72,0.5*72);	% allow for nonprinting margin
% 		for i=0:7.5*72:width
% 			for j=0:10*72:height
% 				pageRect=mosaicRect;
% 				OffsetRect(&pageRect,-i,-j);
% 				ImageToPs('test.ps',m,pageRect);
% 			end
% 		end
%
% In case your PostScript manual isn't handy, the easy way to obtain
% multiple copies of each page is to use the #copies variable that's built
% into Postscript. Anywhere in your file before "showpage", set #copies to
% the desired value: '/#copies 3 def\n'
%
% There are many free PostScript downloaders, but I find them clumsy to
% use, especially the ones that don't inform you of errors, should they
% occur. I like these:
%
% BBEdit (used to come with an extension for downloading postscript)
%
% (Don't know if this is still available.)

% BUGS:
% The "resolution" parameter is ignored by my Apple LaserWriter 16/600.
% I've looked at the PostScript code in the .eps file and it looks
% perfect. For reasons that I don't understand, the printer is ignoring
% the setscreen command, leaving you at the default printer resolution.
