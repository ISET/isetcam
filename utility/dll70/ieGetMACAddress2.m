function MAC = ieGetMACAddress2
%Read the local machine's MAC address
%
%   MAC = ieGetMacAdress2
%
% Alternate function to ieGetMACAddress.  That one seems faster and pretty
% reliable.  But we had one site where it failed so I wrote this one as an
% alternate.
%
% The routine works by calling ipconfig, searching for the Physical Address
% and then manipulating the string.
%
% The separators in the MAC address are : to match ieGetMACAddress. Thus,
% an example address is 00:13:02:64:fd:09
%
% This routine is used whenever the license is checked for certain types of
% licenses.  It is slower than ieGetMACAddress.  It is faster than nothing.
%
% The routine GetMAC might also be used, but it doesn't seem faster (maybe
% slower).  There may be java options.  See comments below.  These may be
% faster.
%
% Example:
%  ieGetMACAddress2
