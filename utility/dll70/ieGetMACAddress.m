function MAC = ieGetMACAddress
%Read the local machine's MAC address
%
%   MAC = ieGetMacAdress
%
% This M-file is used for Linux and Apple architectures. For Windows there
% is a ieGetMACAddress mex file.  That one seems faster and pretty
% reliable.  But we had one site where it failed so I wrote this one as an
% alternate.
%
% The routine works by calling ipconfig, searching for the Physical Address
% and then manipulating the string.
%
% The separators in the MAC address are : to match ieGetMACAddress. Thus,
% an example address is 00:13:02:64:fd:09
%
% This routine is used whenever the license is checked for certain types of
% licenses.  It is slower than the mex-file ieGetMACAddress.  It is faster
% than nothing.
%
% The routine GetMAC might also be used, but it doesn't seem faster (maybe
% slower).  There may be java options.  See comments below.  These may be
% faster.
%
% This routine is mainly used to set up the original key.  There are some
% sites that use this routine every time a window is opened (if the key is
% locked to the particular computer rather than to a particular user). But
% that is not typical.
%
% Example:
%  ieGetMACAddress
