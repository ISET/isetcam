%% Validation of the sensorCompute routines
%
%  Create a standard sensor and a uniform input image.  Calculate how the
%  exposure times vary as we change the pixel size and the f-number of the
%  diffraction-limited imaging lens.  We use the number calculated in the
%  past as a validation that the basic calculations have not been changed
%  as we edit the software.
%
%
%  I should write a test that shows that doubling the pixel size, which
%  4x the area, should reduce the exposure time by 4x.  THere is a very
%  small error for the f/8 case as the pixel size increases.  It might be
%  the auto exposure routine or it might be some problem with accounting
%  for the spatial sampling between the optical image and the sensor.
