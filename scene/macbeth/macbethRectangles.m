function [mLocs,delta,pSize] = macbethRectangles(cornerPoints)
% Deprecated:  Use chartRectangles
%
% Calculate mid point of rectangles for an MCC from the corner points
%
%   [mLocs,delta,pSize] = macbethRectangles(cornerPoints)
%
% Inputs:
%  cornerPoints:  A 4x2 matrix of four points indicating the corners of
%     the region we want to parcel up.  The order is lower left, lower
%     right, upper right, upper left.  They can be chosen using the GUI and
%     macbethSelect.  The entries are (row,col), which is (y,x).
%
% Returns
%  mLocs:  Middle locations of the MCC patches. (size is 2x24)
%  delta:  Size in pixels of the selected region.
%  pSize:  Patch size in pixels. Covers about 1/3 of the square (pSize = 2*delta + 1;)
