function [ip, wgts] = ipHDRWhite(ip,varargin)
% Apply HDR whitening to nearly saturated values
%
% Synopsis
%    [ip, wgts] = ipHDRWhite(ip,varargin)
%
% Brief
%   Method to deal with saturated pixels when rendering HDR scenes,
%   particularly with very bright light sources.  This moves the very
%   bright regions towards white.
%
% Inputs
%   ip:  Image processing (IP) structure with the rgb values computed
%
% Key/val:
%   saturation: The saturation level in the 'input' field.  This
%               depends on whether the input is in digital values or volts
%   hdr level:  What fraction of saturation starts the scaling towards
%               white.  For scenes when the lights are extremely bright
%               compared to anything else (i.e., very HDR) the value
%               doesn't matter much.
%   wgt blur:   How much to blur the saturation weight map.  
%               (default: 2 pixels)
%
% Outputs
%   ip:    IP structure with modified output (results) field
%   wgts:  The weight map.  Mostly the weights are zeros; they
%          approach 1 near the bright lights. 
%
% Description
%   High dynamic range scenes often have saturated pixels.  The typical
%   linear transformation we use to color transform the data does not apply
%   correctly to these saturated pixels. This can lead to unwanted color
%   appearance in the rendering.
%
%   This algorithm finds pixel locations from the input to the IP that are
%   near saturation.  It over-writes the default linear calculation
%   produced by ipCompute, mapping the color at these saturated pixels
%   towards white.
%
%   The algorithm identifies the pixels starting at 'hdrlevel' of the input
%   saturation level (default: 0.95). It transforms the current value
%   ('result') towards (1,1,1) by taking a weight of result and (1,1,1).
%
%      newResult = (1-wgt)*result + wgt*ones.
% 
%   Values less than 0.95 of saturation have zero weight on ones. Values at
%   saturation are set to ones.

% This formula has a weight of 0 when input is at the hdrLevel and a weight
% of 1 when input equals saturation

% For example, try putting in different values here
%

 input = (1:saturation);
 wgts = (input/saturation - hdrLevel) / (1 - hdrLevel);

wgts = (input/saturation - hdrLevel) / (1-hdrLevel);

% We blur the weights a little because of the Bayer mosaic. We have
% had cases where the green is saturated, but the adjacen red or blue
% is not. Such weights can have a regular pattern that is not
% desirable.

% Maybe the size/std should be a parameter.
