%% Convert Gretag.bmp to a plausible gbrg sensor data file
%
% The image created is in a one channel TIF file and the entries represent
% the voltages at each color pixel (GBRG format).
%
% This image is useful for reading into the sensor image window and
% demonstrating ISET features.  The data in this image are not precisely
% the same as the data we use for accurate MCC renderings.  So the related
% script has some error in the attempted correct.  I think that's OK (or
% even useful).

%% Read the BMP file

fName = 'Gretag.bmp';
mosaic = imread(fName); % We are treating these as sensor volts
mosaic = double(mosaic) / 255; % imwrite needs [0,1]

%% Convert to the gb/rg format

% Initialize
r = size(mosaic, 1);
c = size(mosaic, 2);
sensorMosaic = zeros(r, c);

% Two green samples
sensorMosaic(1:2:end, 1:2:end) = mosaic(1:2:end, 1:2:end, 2);
sensorMosaic(2:2:end, 2:2:end) = mosaic(2:2:end, 2:2:end, 2);

% Blue sample
sensorMosaic(1:2:end, 2:2:end) = mosaic(1:2:end, 2:2:end, 3);

% Red sample
sensorMosaic(2:2:end, 1:2:end) = mosaic(2:2:end, 1:2:end, 1);

% A monochrome image, sampled for GBRG format
% imtool(sensorMosaic)

%% Write the data as a single image plane

fname = fullfile(isetRootPath, 'data', 'sensor', 'gbrgMCCSensor.tif');
imwrite(sensorMosaic, fname, 'tif');
